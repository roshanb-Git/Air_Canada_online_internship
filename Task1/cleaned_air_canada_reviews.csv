"✅Trip Verified|   Delay a flight 6 times before announcing a cancel, with customer service having no idea of the status of the pilots coming in. Making baggage claim so late (by not sending a team to a flight that had been delayed then cancelled over ten hours) that it was impossible to book a hotel. Vaguely saying ""we'll give you a voucher"" and bailing on you. No real updates. Why not cancel the flight earlier, or release our baggage? Was it worth the slim shot at saving the $600 for passenger comp? Sending baggage onwards without checking in or asking. I waited 4 hours to make sure my baggage is secure, only to have it shipped in front of me ruining the whole point. In two separate points. One agent telling me that they don't care in domestic about bags, so keep it tight with you (why I stayed an extra 4 hours or so) - just to have Air Canada say YOLO and ship it onwards. Not even having the presence of mind to hand out food, food vouchers, anything after passengers were placed in a hot plane, deplaned, and made to stand for 10 hours+. This could have been the easiest token. Having super long lines at every step of the process and being understaffed. For example, the baggage claim line had three people at the counter, and one person checking or doing something while dozens of passengers were waiting in line. Full hands on deck? Not the case with Air Canada, by understaffing. I generally blame management for putting staff and passengers in this situation - that said, some staff members were supremely unhelpful in a way that boggles the mind. Why even make gate announcements if you work for the company and literally have no better idea than any of us what is going on? Is checking who is ""priority"" really the best way you can use your time given a baggage line that runs hours on average? Is it impossible to anticipate a situation like this and having agents be reachable in some way? Not a great time to have only 2-3 people operate a counter when the line is like 800 deep? One thing that stood out is that this seemed uniquely bad for Air Canada. This is very surprising, because airlines like Flair and Westjet have much worse reputations. But from what I could observe, all Air Canada flights were affected.",delay flight time announc cancel custom servic idea statu pilot come make baggag claim late send team flight delay cancel ten hour imposs book hotel vagu say give voucher bail real updat cancel flight earlier releas baggag worth slim shot save passeng comp send baggag onward without check ask wait hour make sure baggag secur ship front ruin whole point two separ point one agent tell care domest bag keep tight stay extra hour air canada say yolo ship onward even presenc mind hand food food voucher anyth passeng place hot plane deplan made stand hour could easiest token super long line everi step process understaf exampl baggag claim line three peopl counter one person check someth dozen passeng wait line full hand deck case air canada understaf gener blame manag put staff passeng situat said staff member suprem unhelp way boggl mind even make gate announc work compani liter better idea us go check prioriti realli best way use time given baggag line run hour averag imposs anticip situat like agent reachabl way great time peopl oper counter line like deep one thing stood seem uniqu bad air canada surpris airlin like flair westjet much wors reput could observ air canada flight affect

"Not Verified|   Airline is strict with carryon limit, size (even if 1 inch off), so be aware. They demanded I check in bag (w/$35 fee) and made a scene of it (while we were completely silent. Then, checked our bag into someone else's itinerary, delaying arrival of baggage for 1.5 days. Finally refunded the $35 fee but am still waiting for incidentals costs (which I'm not expecting to get - simple night wear, toothbrush, etc.). Then, to top it off, they lost our luggage again for 1 day on our return trip (home). No incidentals incurred this time, but we got our $35 luggage fee back on that one too but within reasonable time. Both of those fees should be refunded immediately without the extra work of filing out forms online, then waiting before receiving. That was our first trip with Air Canada. On the plus side, entertainment and flight crew were excellent (beyond other airline experiences). It took awhile to get our drinks, but I believe that was due to turbulence.",verifi airlin strict carryon limit size even inch awar demand check bag w fee made scene complet silent check bag someon els itinerari delay arriv baggag day final refund fee still wait incident cost expect get simpl night wear toothbrush etc top lost luggag day return trip home incident incur time got luggag fee back one within reason time fee refund immedi without extra work file form onlin wait receiv first trip air canada plu side entertain flight crew excel beyond airlin experi took awhil get drink believ due turbul

"✅Trip Verified| On the way to Istanbul the flight from Orlando was delayed, I couldn’t make my connection. Finally arrived to Istanbul for a major oral surgery. Bags never arrived until 3 days later. No assistance whatsoever with that. On the way back, August 14th, I head to the airport 3 hours before the departure time. At the counter I am told that my name is nowhere to be found, I have all the confirmation numbers needed. I had my father contact Air Canada from the US knowing that I had no other way to communicate with them. They tell me that the flight should be good and there is no problem. I go back to the counter. Same thing I don’t exist. I was told that they can see the Paris to Montreal portion but no Istanbul to Paris. Father on the phone for a very long time with Air Canada. No help. The flight has departed. Stranded in Istanbul Air Canada had the guts to ask me for $1700 to fly back the following day. Absolutely disgusting. Here I am stuck in a foreign country, with only a couple large bills on me. And they are asking me for $1700 and that there is nothing they do about it. After numerous calls I was able to find a family member who purchased a one was ticket for me for $1398. What’s else can I say? I am shocked and disgusted.

"Not Verified| AIR CANADA decided on the spot to cancel the connecting flight from Toronto to Washington DC on July 17th 2024 afternoon. When arriving to Toronto from Calgary on July 17th, the connecting flight was on the board saying ""on-time"". About one hour before the scheduled departure, it changed to ""delay 30 min"" and about 20 minutes later changed again to ""flight cancelled"". Checking at the gate what's going on, AIR CANADA person told us there is a weather issue - this why the flight is cancelled. The weather that afternoon in Toronto was perfect! Checking later what was the weather in the destination airport - DCA, shows that at the timeframe we were suppose to arrive to DCA (between 6 pm to 12 pm) about 15 -20 other flights from different airlines arrived and landed safely - so there was no significant major weather blocking this flight from taking place due to weather at the destination either. This was a complete fake excuse made by AIR CANADA, not to operate this flight. Obviously nobody from AIR CANADA gives any explanation or a proof. They just announce it and we - the passengers - can do nothing about it. But - this was only the beginning. Air CANADA didn't offer any solution for this flight passengers, no compensation, no hotel, no meal - not even a glass of water. The option given was to take this flight after 28 hours from the original departure time (just for part of the people - others got nothing). Actually, they kind of ""celebrated"" the event. ""This is a Weather case, so we owe nothing to the passengers, this is our regulations, good luck for you"" Anyway, this was just a one hour flight +/-, so we decided to rent a car and drive the 8 hours distance and took a hotel for a night sleep on the way, since we had hard obligations for the next day in Washington DC. The rudest and most annoying response from Air CANADA after all this, is that they refuse to pay back the extra expenses taken by us to reach our destination, due to this irresponsible and unloyalty behaviour of AIR CANADA. Bottom line - AIR CANADA has cancelled a flight on the spot without any justified reason, without giving a reasonable alternative solution and refuse to pay back any compensation or expense to the passengers.",air canada decid spot cancel connect flight toronto washington dc juli th afternoon arriv toronto calgari juli th connect flight board say time one hour schedul departur chang delay min minut later chang flight cancel check gate go air canada person told us weather issu flight cancel weather afternoon toronto perfect check later weather destin airport dca show timefram suppos arriv dca pm pm flight differ airlin arriv land safe signific major weather block flight take place due weather destin either complet fake excus made air canada oper flight obvious nobodi air canada give explan proof announc passeng noth begin air canada offer solut flight passeng compens hotel meal even glass water option given take flight hour origin departur time part peopl other got noth actual kind celebr event weather case owe noth passeng regul good luck anyway one hour flight decid rent car drive hour distanc took hotel night sleep way sinc hard oblig next day washington dc rudest annoy respons air canada refus pay back extra expens taken us reach destin due irrespons unloyalti behaviour air canada bottom line air canada cancel flight spot without justifi reason without give reason altern solut refus pay back compens expens passeng

Mid-flight, she started to get really anxious and I tried calming her down and one flight attendant I think her name was Angie she had saw and when she noticed she came right over to help. She sat with my grandma for a few minutes and held her hand, and talked to her and me and asked if we had any plans in Austin or if we were visiting other family. After she had continued her duties. She even checked on my grandma during the flight to make sure she had enough water too even though there was many other passengers to attend too as well.

Not only did they give a paper towel, they never came by to check up. I had to go back few times to ask for some more. I don’t expect them to clean up for me nor have incredible service.

"Not Verified|   I have been a loyal customer of Air Canada for many years, specifically during the 13 years from 2008 when my job required frequent travel. Whenever possible, I chose Air Canada for my journeys. However, I have observed a decline in the quality of service. Regrettably, I have noticed that the attentiveness and politeness of the flight attendants have diminished. In comparison to other airlines I have traveled with, such as Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Korean Air, British Airways, and various American carriers, Air Canada's service has not been up to par. My recent experience with Lufthansa was particularly pleasant; the crew treated passengers with genuine smiles and excellent service. In contrast, Air Canada's flight attendants display a demeanor that suggests they view themselves as victims, and this attitude unfortunately affects their interactions with passengers. For instance, during a recent flight, there was turbulence, and the captain announced that hot beverages would not be served due to safety concerns, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated. When the seatbelt sign was later turned off, a flight attendant approached to offer drinks. I mentioned that I would like a coffee but was aware that hot beverages were not being served due to the turbulence. Instead of a polite clarification, the attendant responded with, ""Can't you see the seatbelt light came off?"" Her words were laced with sarcasm, which I found quite unpleasant. As a result of these experiences, I have decided to choose other airlines for my future travels. My wife and I will be traveling to Europe this October, and we have chosen not to fly with Air Canada. I hope this feedback is taken into consideration to improve the service quality and customer experience.",loyal custom air canada mani year specif year job requir frequent travel whenev possibl chose air canada journey howev observ declin qualiti servic regrett notic attent polit flight attend diminish comparison airlin travel qatar airway lufthansa klm turkish airlin korean air british airway variou american carrier air canada servic par recent experi lufthansa particularli pleasant crew treat passeng genuin smile excel servic contrast air canada flight attend display demeanor suggest view victim attitud unfortun affect interact passeng instanc recent flight turbul captain announc hot beverag would serv due safeti concern seatbelt sign illumin seatbelt sign later turn flight attend approach offer drink mention would like coffe awar hot beverag serv due turbul instead polit clarif attend respond see seatbelt light came word lace sarcasm found quit unpleas result experi decid choos airlin futur travel wife travel europ octob chosen fli air canada hope feedback taken consider improv servic qualiti custom experi

"✅Trip Verified|  We generally have preferred flying with Air Canada in the past but had just flown to and from Europe on Icelandair. We then flew home from Toronto to Vancouver on Air Canada. We were seated in an exit row just behind Premium Economy. By comparison with Icelandair, the cabin felt old, dark and smelled musty. The stewards seemed unorganized, did not say anything to us about the exit row protocol and took up to half hour to respond to the call button. The snacks were dry-as-sawdust pretzels, and the beer was warm. The headphone plugs did not work and the fold-up monitor would not rise up to be seen from my seat.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada cancelled my flight with less than 10 hours notice by text saying ""due to weather"". This cancellation caused me to miss all my connecting flights to a trip to Peru which cost me over $3000 to rebook on the day of all my missed flights. Cancellation due to weather was a lie as the communications line to Whitehorse had been severed and therefore, they cancelled the flight because they could not access their systems (can prove this with news stories). This was confirmed by Air Canada Employees at the airport when half of the plane showed up to check in at 3 AM. However, since they had used weather as the cause for cancellation they would not help me cover any of my rebooking costs as they say that they can't control the weather. What's even worse is that they are allowed to change the initial reason for cancelling the flight to something other than weather (like no access to their systems) but because the initial reasoning was weather, they can still avoid responsibility and doing the right thing. Air North was fantastic and was the only reason I was able to make it to Vancouver to rebook my entire trip.

"✅Trip Verified| I recently paid $5700 for a flight which was business class outbound and only premium economy return YVR-HKG. On the business portion from YVR-HKG the entertainment system and screen malfunctioned including constantly turning on in a dark cabin while most were trying to sleep. I book business class for 3 reasons, comfort of seat, entertainment value, and meal/in-flight service. When one of these 3 services is not provided then I am no longer satisfied with the fees I paid for this class of travel. The Head-purser tried to reset a number of times then 2 flight attendants spent all kinds of time taping 2 cushions to the screen. My return flight in Premium was no better. Although I had paid $5700 for my flight and the passenger next to me $6000 for his round-trip YVR-HKG in Premium both of us were informed early on we wouldn't have a choice of meals as the Vegetarian was the only option left. While I have experienced this same problem a few years back on Air Canada I really can't believe this airline can't put enough meals on board to offer the selection they advertise. Unlike business, there was no option days before to select the meal you want and alleviate this entire issue. They absolutely treat this class (Premium) like standard economy although they now charge a multiplier of 3-3.5 times the standard economy cost. Wake up Air Canada! In the end I was offered $150 credit for my troubles and after going back to them again and again they have refused to show more compassion. With the offer of a $150 coupon they are basically suggesting I would have paid for this business class travel @ a price of $5700 with an offer of ""minus $150"" but no entertainment service. Would anyone book that class of travel if they were told of this full ticket price minus $150 because you will not be providing any entertainment? In addition to the absence of entertainment my comfort was significantly disrupted because of a screen turning on frequently with full brightness in a darkened (resting) cabin.

"✅Trip Verified|  I flew with Air Canada on 27 of May this year. I waited at the airport for 6 hours for a connecting flight to Montreal, which is approximately a 30-minute flight from Quebec airport. The flight did not leave from Quebec due to construction at the landing strip at the airport in Montreal, that is what the airline informed us in Quebec City. It seems as if they delay flights until they are fully booked, regardless of the scheduled departure time, and Air Canada offer no compensation for the inconvenience. After finally leaving Quebec and landing in Montreal I was informed there will be no other flight to Miami until the next morning due to weather. No accommodations were provided; I was told to find and pay for my own lodging. And just to add a fun fact I paid 332.01 for one night to Holliday Inn that was near by the airport to take advantage of the free shuttle because transportation was not offer either. This is utterly disrespectful. In addition to refusing to refund my expenses for the night, I discovered the next morning at the airport a couple from the same flight and same economy class received accommodations and meal vouchers from the airline. It's perplexing why some passengers receive preferential treatment. Hard to believe when the tickets are high priced and not even a direct flight. I advise against flying with Air Canada unless you have surplus time and money.",flew air canada may year wait airport hour connect flight montreal approxim minut flight quebec airport flight leav quebec due construct land strip airport montreal airlin inform us quebec citi seem delay flight fulli book regardless schedul departur time air canada offer compens inconveni final leav quebec land montreal inform flight miami next morn due weather accommod provid told find pay lodg add fun fact paid one night holliday inn near airport take advantag free shuttl transport offer either utterli disrespect addit refus refund expens night discov next morn airport coupl flight economi class receiv accommod meal voucher airlin perplex passeng receiv preferenti treatment hard believ ticket high price even direct flight advis fli air canada unless surplu time money
"✅Trip Verified|  I booked with air Canada for the purposes of an international move to the UK. I chose to fly into France because it was the only way I could fly with my dog in the cabin with me. I called and upgraded my ticket from economy to business so he would have more room. I bought a carrier that his head touches when he is standing but he is capable of turning around in. When I upgraded my ticket, I paid for pet in cabin, $100. Air Canada texted me when I was on my way to the airport to let me know my flight had been cancelled and they would update me in 30 mins. 30 mins comes and goes and no update so I call customer service who tells me they’ve rebooked me on the same flight for the same time just a different plane. And they didn't tell me. I would have missed my flight if I hadn’t called. I got to Vancouver at 6 am and spent the next 50 mins attempting to check in. The employee was not going to check me in because I did not have a return ticket from France. I showed him evidence of intent to leave the country in the form of a eurotunnel check in and hotel stay. He would not accept it and asked his coworker for help. Coworker confirmed it would be okay. He still called for a supervisor. Supervisor confirmed it was okay. He still fought me on it because the eurotunnel check in has a return itinerary and even though I explained three times that I was flying and my husband was driving from England to pick me up and we would be returning in the eurotunnel together which he booked with a return trip because he was coming from the UK. Then he made a big deal about the fact that I didn’t have 120 in euros, despite having a bank account with money in it, which his supervisor approved. So then he takes my bags and I’m like do I have to pick them up and recheck them or go through additional security? And at first he was like no, when he thought I had a large case and a carry on. He asked if the large case was my only checked bag and I said no, I have a pet in cabin so I have to check my carry on as well. He was like you have a pet in cabin? I said Yes, it should be a part of my booking. He said Okay I need to look at him. He comes around the counter and looks at my pet in the closed carrier, Asks me to open it. Tobes is laying there and not getting up. The guy is like “I need to call a supervisor.” So he calls the supervisor again. Tells her my dog can’t stand up and turn around, which he doesn’t know because the dog didn’t stand up for him. She asks to see my pet, she gets him out, tells me he’s too big but makes an exception because he’s terrified and jumping into the carrier again. Then the guy tells me that because I have a pet in cabin, I will need to collect my checked bags and go through security again. I’m like wait what? Why? He doesn’t explain, just says that’s the policy. Doesn’t make sense. Later he tells me that I don’t have to do that. Then he bills me another $100 for pet in cabin when I already paid it. I was like if that is the only thing standing between me getting on the plane with the dog, I will pay it again but I’m leaving a horrible review because I’ve been here trying to check in for 50 minutes. He was like if you paid it would say you paid. I’m like it’s a part of my booking, how did I not pay if I booked it? I did not get mad or lose my temper the whole time until he charged me a second time for the pet in cabin. Then, I get through security and get settled at the gate.

"✅Trip Verified|  Flight was late by nearly 2 hours. The attendant spent an hour asking passengers near the gate to check their carry-on bags since there wasn't enough space, and threatening that if we didn't have enough volunteers all passengers would need to check their bags, ""no exceptions"". How is that the fault of passengers that you don't have enough space? When it was time to board at the gate, the attendant called everyone in a disorganized fashion, and not acknowledging the fact that the gate next to them had just called passengers too. It resulted in a big bottleneck, and nobody could reach the gate because it was so crowded. We almost didn't make it on the flight.

"✅Trip Verified|  Faulty website and terrible customer service. I bought an additional checked bag online. However, that information was not available in the airport system and the agent told me “no you have not paid for it.” After I showed them the email receipt, they had to manually add it, and as I only had an email receipt and not a paper receipt, I had to keep unlocking my phone for the agent to manually add it. Which caused further delays during the check in process. The agent also had a very rude attitude towards me. During check in, when I have trouble lifting such a heavy bag, there is usually always an agent there to help with it. However, when I was having trouble lifting the 50 lbs bag and asked if anyone can give me a hand, the agent mentioned, “no our insurance doesn’t cover it.” I also reserved an aisle seat during the online check in process. However, my boarding pass had a window seat. Customers should not be offered a service that cannot be provided. The website mentioned inflight WiFi but no WiFi was provided. The seat had very little leg room and I’m only 5’1”.

They waited until the flight was supposed to take off then said it would be a 30 minute delay. Every 30 minutes they repeated the process until we boarded 3 hours late. While other airlines were automatically issuing food vouchers to waiting passengers, Air Canada told everyone on the intercom to ""go buy your own food"" then delayed us for 3 hours anyway! On the plane, the flight attendant was scoffing at me for wanting something simple like water or to switch a seat because there were many empty rows.",worst long haul flight ever taken start air canada updat delay toronto due food servic strike wait flight suppos take said would minut delay everi minut repeat process board hour late airlin automat issu food voucher wait passeng air canada told everyon intercom go buy food delay us hour anyway plane flight attend scof want someth simpl like water switch seat mani empti row

"✅Trip Verified|  Me and my sister had a flight on 4th April from Toronto to Kuala Lumpur (KL) where we have 2 stopovers, one at Montreal and another at Dubai. The flights to Montreal were delayed at first and then cancelled due to a snow storm in Montreal. So we requested if they can rebook from Toronto to Dubai since flights to Montreal are all cancelled and even if we make it to Montreal not sure if we can able to get a flight from there to Dubai. We waited at the service counter for almost 2 hours since the flight from Dubai is under Emirates and they need some time to check something. They rebooked a different ticket saying that the other ticket from Dubai to KL is still valid. So, we flew to Dubai and had to book a last min hotel since we were going to be there for 12 hours. We checked in 4 baggages and out of 4 we managed to get 3 baggages saying one has already transited to Dubai. When we were trying to check in the luggage, we were told can't check in till we get the other 1 baggage. I literally had to go up and down and finally one of the guy told the other staff that they just have to untag it and give a new tag. The airline staff system knowledge are very bad and seems like only a few staff know what they're doing and others have zero knowledge. Later, we were not able to board our next flight from Dubai to KL (we were already at the gate entrance to get into the plane) because our ticket says that the ticket is cancelled. Apparently, the staff who did the rebooking didn't update the system and even Emirates can't help us since AirCanada made the changes. We called the AirCanada customer service and after an hour we managed to get another flight. So, we had to wait for 10 hours at Dubai airport for the mistake that they had done. We wasted around 15 hours due to this hassle. I can understand if the flight was cancelled due to a cause of nature but it's the staff's work ethics and efficiency is what I can't accept at all. Also, there's no compensation given due to this.

"✅Trip Verified|  I bought six business class Air Canada tickets from Washington to Nairobi rtn for a family trip through Expedia. Air Canada provided the first leg but was responsible for the entire itinerary because the tickets were on their paper. Our flights from Toronto to Nairobi and return were on Lufthansa. The night before our departure from DC, AC advised that it had cancelled our initial flights. It was astoundingly difficult to reach the AC help desk and I was kept on hold or talking from 10pm to 4am. Finally, I had my party rerouted, with me now on United to Toronto and my wife on AC. When I went to the United counter, it turned out that the AC agent had messed up the booking. United required me to get AC to fix it, which took a long time. When we arrived in Nairobi I noticed that our return flights no longer showed in the Lufthansa system. AC had screwed up our booking by adding new flights, rather than changing our outbound flights, so Lufthansa treated us as no-shows on the outbound and, as is standard practice, cancelled our return flights. Another 12 hours listening to the AC dialtone and dealing with hopeless AC agents, trying to blame Lufthansa for their mistakes, ensued. Eventually, AC was able to unscramble the mess they'd created and got Lufthansa to honor our return tickets. I waited to do this review hoping that AC might improve, but I can see from other reviews that the problems of hopeless support remain. Buy a ticket on AC at your own risk and only when prepared to spend all night trying to get AC staff to fix the problems they've carelessly created.",bought six busi class air canada ticket washington nairobi rtn famili trip expedia air canada provid first leg respons entir itinerari ticket paper flight toronto nairobi return lufthansa night departur dc ac advis cancel initi flight astoundingli difficult reach ac help desk kept hold talk pm final parti rerout unit toronto wife ac went unit counter turn ac agent mess book unit requir get ac fix took long time arriv nairobi notic return flight longer show lufthansa system ac screw book ad new flight rather chang outbound flight lufthansa treat us show outbound standard practic cancel return flight anoth hour listen ac dialton deal hopeless ac agent tri blame lufthansa mistak ensu eventu ac abl unscrambl mess creat got lufthansa honor return ticket wait review hope ac might improv see review problem hopeless support remain buy ticket ac risk prepar spend night tri get ac staff fix problem carelessli creat

We were scheduled to have a direct flight to Ottawa from Vancouver and they changed it to a stopover in Toronto 2 days later! After being on hold to customer service for 2 hours I spoke to an agent who was trying to reroute for the Monday, the day we were to return but could only get us home by going to Toronto first. As she worked on the flights we were disconnected, another hour on hold to get a snotty agent who wanted anything but to help. after an hour of attitude she got us through Toronto but delayed and had to spend the night. Heading to Ottawa the following day, now 36 hours after the original scheduled landing. Air Canada refused to pay for the hotel in Toronto, the extra meals, parking. Basically saying it wasn't their fault their plane was unsafe to fly. Just the month before we paid for 4 flights to get to Estonia and back. Paying extra for seat with more leg room. What we got was bulkhead which I expected but they put a baby crib in front of our seats and we couldn't even raise our monitors to watch a movie. Just a kid crying for 8 hours.

"Not Verified| The flight from Narita Tokyo to Vancouver was OK, left on time, arrived on time. The problem started for the connecting flight: Vancouver to Portland). Months ago, Air Canada booked my connecting flight out of Vancouver late afternoon, although there was an earlier one. I could have saved 3 hours (and make my connection!), not sure why they decided to keep me waiting at YVR for over 5 hours coming from Japan. The plane to Portland arrived late, the departure time was pushed 40 minutes, we boarded, the plane went on the tarmack, there we waited 30 minutes, then back to the gate. There was a mechanical problem. After another 20 minutes, it was decided the flight was cancelled. This is where customer service should have kicked in. The flight attendant said we had to leave the plane. No mention of connecting flights, no agents from AC were assigned to help us; there was ZERO help or assistance to help us book a new flight. We walked for miles, crossed the long airport, picked our luggage, went through immigration and customs, looked for the right Air Canada counter, then waited in line for more than one hour; of course they had a few agents totally overwhelmed with the flow of passengers. The only pm flight to Portland was sold out, we spent the night in VC and delayed 24 hrs our arrival. I lost my hotel reservation in Portland. I dont blame AC for cancelling the flight, for security reasons. But they showed a total lack of customer service assistance to book the replacement flight.

"Not Verified| Very disappointed. If possible I will avoid flying with Air Canada in the future. I was supposed to fly from Calgary to Amsterdam with a layover in Toronto. On the day of departure I was informed that my flight was delayed with an hour. A few hours later I was informed that my first flight would be delayed 3 hours which would cause me to miss my connection in Toronto. After calling (over an hour waiting to talk to an agent) I was offered a flight over London Heathrow which would stretch my 11 hour trip to a 20 hour trip. Then that flight got cancelled as well and another flight was offered which would mean I would leave 4 hours later than planned and make the trip over 25 hours. I turned that down. That day, I spent over 3 hours on the phone talking to agents or waiting my turn. This trip was planned months ahead of time. I missed my mothers 75 birthday, had taken days off for this trip, had to plan work ahead for the time I would be absent. When I requested compensation, an agent directed me to the website.

I did self baggage drop at YYZ and received an email from Air Canada confirming receipt. I noticed there was a technical problem at the self drop counters 30 mins after my luggage was dropped. Didn't think that affected me but I was shocked to receive a text msg upon arrival that my bag was delayed in YYZ. There were at least another 14 passengers like me. So I filed the incident at EZE and got a ticket. They said my bag would arrive on Mar 6 but I told them my cruise was leaving Buenos Aires on Mar 5 evening and need it delivered to the cruise port before that. The crew said there's no flight between YYZ and EZE on Mar 5 which I find unbelievable. Needless to say that didn't happen and I left with the cruise ship baggage less. My next port is Montevideo  which is very close to Buenos Aires and I would be there on Mar 6 until 6 pm. I heard nothing from Air Canada and had to email and call them several times until I finally received an email saying they will reroute my bag to Ushuaia which is the port of call on Mar 12. That is 8 days late and I'm already 60% into my cruise. Moreover I do not have any toiletries or undergarments plus no winter clothing. Where I started it's 28C and once past Mar 9 the temp will drop to 10C or lower as the ship sails southbound towards Antarctica. I am also booked on 2 excursions for penguins and wildlife sightings before Mar 12 that require hiking boots and water repellent jackets, both in my checked bag. Getting money compensation was not only insufficient to cover all these items, but impossible to find them in Buenos Aires or Montevideo within the 5-6 hrs I have onshore. Air Canada responded that they can ship my bag to an airport that is an hour away from my next port Puerto Madryn and ask me to find out if Princess can go pick it up. Isn't Air Canada's responsible to ensure the delayed bag is shipped to where I am within a reasonable time? From Mar 4 to Mar 8 is already not a reasonable time. Princess has been very helpful letting me use their front desk phone to make international calls to Air Canada and also agrees to go pick up my luggage if it can be shipped to a closer airport than the one suggested. Last I know my bag was scanned at Sao Paulo Brazil airport. No idea why it's there and the thought of losing my bag with all belongings is haunting me. I am not sure how I would continue my cruise and this has ruined an otherwise experience of a lifetime. Air Can has handled this so poorly.

The first time I booked the transaction said that it was unsuccessful so I did it again. PayPal charged me twice. Then I contacted PayPal and Air Canada and was refunded one of the booking. Then two weeks later Air Canada refunded the other booking and I was left without any flights. I went to book only to find that the payment would be $3500+. I contacted Air Canada and was given a discount code to use, could not use the discount code on multi city flights so change my plans to fly Brisbane to Vancouver, Vancouver to Brisbane.

"✅Trip Verified|  An awful trip on Air Canada in December. Business class was not served hot food or drinks, but a choice of limited snacks - chips, chocolate bars, and candies, instead of hot sandwiches, salads, or something more substantial. The Air Canada lounge in Edmonton was a huge disappointment, with no hot food options, only cold and fairly tasteless wraps. The seat in business class was not a lie flat seat on this 1 hr 50 mins flight. I waited a long time in Vancouver for checked baggage, even though I was travelling in a premium cabin.

"Not Verified| My flight was from Bangkok to Toronto. Air Canada did not come out with the meals until about 60-40 mins before landing. The staff provided the meal fine but came by and threw out the whole meal after I had only managed to get the fruit down. They then came over and verbally attacked me for complaining about it. After the flight landed I had 30 mins before my connecting flight started to board. As this was going from an international flight to a domestic flight I have to collect my baggage (which didn't come out until the other fight was already boarding) go out through customs, recheck my bags, and clear security again before I could head to the gate. I literally had to run through the whole airport to make my connecting flight. I asked for help from the Air Canada desk and they were just rude and unhelpful. My layover was in Vancouver. On landing in Toronto I had yet to be fed anything other than the couple pieces of fruit from the lunch they threw out.

"Not Verified|  If you value your peace of mind, time and money do not fly with Air Canada. It seems over the past year, Air Canada's reliability has become horrendous. My partner landed at PVG to connect to his final flight to TFU and well....They changed the connecting flight airport!! There was no one at the customer service counter at PVG. Luckily I am still at home in Vancouver and after multiple calls to Air Canada I was able to get my partner rebooked onto another flight to his final destination. It seems Air Canada knew of a mistake as luggage was able to be picked up while my partner was told that the luggage would go to the final destination. Just a horrible experience. Additionally, Air Canada cancelled a trip of mine in June of 2023 hours before our departure. These absurd things seem to be commonplace with Air Canada these days an no matter what garbage their CEO spits out, I won't buy it.",valu peac mind time money fli air canada seem past year air canada reliabl becom horrend partner land pvg connect final flight tfu well chang connect flight airport one custom servic counter pvg luckili still home vancouv multipl call air canada abl get partner rebook onto anoth flight final destin seem air canada knew mistak luggag abl pick partner told luggag would go final destin horribl experi addit air canada cancel trip mine june hour departur absurd thing seem commonplac air canada day matter garbag ceo spit buy
"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada provides a decent service in this class. Seating is pod-style which gives one a fair amount of privacy. Seats convert into flat beds. The only problem is that feet are somewhat cramped for taller passengers. Food is better than average and good selection of beverages is offered. Flight left and arrived on time. FAs were attentive and friendly. I was somewhat disappointed in the IFE as I recall that AC used to have more foreign films on their overseas flights.

"Not Verified| Absolutely avoid Air Canada. I am writing this on behalf of my family who has been waiting for their delayed flight to take off. There flight is delayed by at least 4 hours twice (still waiting to see if they delay a third time). They have a connection in Narita that they will miss because of the delay. Air Canada only has flights available before 6pm from Narita and they will land after this time so they will have to stay the night (nothing has been addressed about any of this yet, Air Canada only said they cannot do anything about it from their end in Toronto). They paid for extra legroom and space for their original flight as my sister is nearing her third trimester in pregnancy and my parents have health problems and are over 60. Their new seats are now at the very back of the plane, no extra space which they paid a lot extra for. So now not only will they lose out on travel time, but they will also lose on money and what they have booked for the following day of their trip (accommodation and tours) as they will not be there in time and it is too close to the time to allow them to get a reimbursement. I have many words for Air Canada but none of them are appropriate for this review. When my sister tries to reach out to try to sort things they are unresponsive.",absolut avoid air canada write behalf famili wait delay flight take flight delay least hour twice still wait see delay third time connect narita miss delay air canada flight avail pm narita land time stay night noth address yet air canada said cannot anyth end toronto paid extra legroom space origin flight sister near third trimest pregnanc parent health problem new seat back plane extra space paid lot extra lose travel time also lose money book follow day trip accommod tour time close time allow get reimburs mani word air canada none appropri review sister tri reach tri sort thing unrespons
"✅Trip Verified| I was shocked by the main meal (dinner) service in Premium Economy. There were only two choices and both were Indian cuisine. Those two choices were butter chicken (non-veg) and a vegetarian option of rice and lentils with some sort of vegetable curry. For a Premium Economy cabin with 24 pax, only four non-veg meals were loaded. Seriously? Even though these flights to/from DEL and BOM are mostly full of people of Indian origin, not everyone is Indian and wants to have NO CHOICE but to eat Indian food. Would it be too much to have a Western option of, say, lamb or chicken. Ridiculous. The dinner service was rushed and my meal was basically thrown at me. Implements were made of wood and same as what is served in regular economy. Drinks were served in paper cups. Overall, a cheap product. I didn’t find the seat comfortable and got no sleep at all on the 16-hour flight. Prior to departure from Delhi, it was obviously that we would miss our connection in Toronto due to late departure from Delhi. The agent at check-in wanted me to check my bags onto my original connecting flight to DCA. I refused and asked that he confirm me on a later flight to IAD and that my bag be tagged accordingly (otherwise I could pretty much guarantee that my bags would end up mis-connecting and I'd have to wait 24 hours for them to be delivered by courier to my home in the DC area). After much back-and-forth and with the help of the DEL Station Manager, I was protected on a later UA-operated flight, code share with AC, to IAD and my bags tagged accordingly. However, upon boarding in YYZ for the IAD flight, I learned that AC in Delhi had not sent UA my ticket number and we were denied boarding. I had to dash to the AC customer service desk (which, fortunately, was beside our gate), but it was swamped with people. I approached the agent at the side of her desk and she was pretty snippy with me. I then found the ticket number in my emails and ran back to the gate to give it to the gate agent. The doors had already closed, but we were able to board and our bags arrived in IAD with us. But just a lot unnecessary stress due to sloppy work by AC in DEL.",shock main meal dinner servic premium economi two choic indian cuisin two choic butter chicken non veg vegetarian option rice lentil sort veget curri premium economi cabin pax four non veg meal load serious even though flight del bom mostli full peopl indian origin everyon indian want choic eat indian food would much western option say lamb chicken ridicul dinner servic rush meal basic thrown implement made wood serv regular economi drink serv paper cup overal cheap product find seat comfort got sleep hour flight prior departur delhi obvious would miss connect toronto due late departur delhi agent check want check bag onto origin connect flight dca refus ask confirm later flight iad bag tag accordingli otherwis could pretti much guarante bag would end mi connect wait hour deliv courier home dc area much back forth help del station manag protect later ua oper flight code share ac iad bag tag accordingli howev upon board yyz iad flight learn ac delhi sent ua ticket number deni board dash ac custom servic desk fortun besid gate swamp peopl approach agent side desk pretti snippi found ticket number email ran back gate give gate agent door alreadi close abl board bag arriv iad us lot unnecessari stress due sloppi work ac del

I found the service comparable to economy now. I had delayed flight but the business class agent was not helpful to find an alternate connecting flight; I was told to use the phone to seek help. The lounge access has become a disgusting experience requiring waits in the long queues. I find that business travel with AC is not worth the money.

We got to Miami Airport at around 9:30am. As you can already tell, this would've been a crazy long wait, especially with 3 young kids. We looked for things to do, and places to eat as to not get bored. Around 10:30am, my husband asked an Air Canada employee where the Air Canada lounge is so we can kill time as we wait for our flight. As my husband was walking away, another employee told us that there are 4 seats available on the 11:30am flight. We then asked my mom and dad if they would like the earlier flight so they do not need to wait for 8+ hours. As we ready their luggages, the staff looked for us to inform us that there were cancellations and we could now all be accommodated. He then worked his magic to make sure we are all seated together.

"✅Trip Verified|  I had an excellent trip with Air Canada on this flight. While there was initially quite a bit of confusion (as for some reason Aer Lingus - who flew the DUB-LHR first leg - wasn't able to see the Codeshare flight), when I called Air Canada the employee on the phone was extremely helpful. They were able to reissue my ticket so that Aer Lingus could see it, and the Air Canada and Aer Lingus employees directly spoke to each other to ensure I was able to get onto the flight as planned. Boarding in LHR was very efficient and was done on time, and the service in the air during the LHR-YYC flight was absolutely excellent. The flight crew was attentive, pleasant, and very caring. The food quality was excellent, and service was very timely. The Business Class seats on the 787-9 were clean, and the in-flight entertainment system was phenomenal (with a very large and highly responsive touch screen). Unfortunately due to the confusion regarding my first leg with Aer Lingus, it appears my bags did not get checked all the way to YYC and instead were sent to the carousel in LHR. When I arrived at YYC and spoke with Air Canada staff there, they were able to immediately let me know where my bags were, and they were delivered to my house the next evening. If it had not been for this baggage issue I would have rated it a 10/10. However, I must commend all of the Air Canada staff who I dealt with throughout this journey, as they were all extremely kind and helpful. I am uncertain as to whether the baggage/flight booking issue was related to Aer Lingus or Air Canada, but that would be the only area for improvement from my perspective.",excel trip air canada flight initi quit bit confus reason aer lingu flew dub lhr first leg abl see codeshar flight call air canada employe phone extrem help abl reissu ticket aer lingu could see air canada aer lingu employe directli spoke ensur abl get onto flight plan board lhr effici done time servic air lhr yyc flight absolut excel flight crew attent pleasant care food qualiti excel servic time busi class seat clean flight entertain system phenomen larg highli respons touch screen unfortun due confus regard first leg aer lingu appear bag get check way yyc instead sent carousel lhr arriv yyc spoke air canada staff abl immedi let know bag deliv hous next even baggag issu would rate howev must commend air canada staff dealt throughout journey extrem kind help uncertain whether baggag flight book issu relat aer lingu air canada would area improv perspect

"Not Verified| Air Canada biz class; pay more for less. Took early morning (boarding 0635h) flight 341 from Ottawa to Vancouver, one of the few non-stop direct options to avoid the passenger insanity of transiting Toronto Pearson airport. It was still dark in Ottawa but was there lighting inside the aircraft? No way! A dim little infill up at the ceiling above the luggage bins. Otherwise, you had to use your phone light to see if the floor was clear as you counted off the seats to find where your tushy was booked for the flight. Would it strain you to flip the ‘on’ light switch, Air Canada? This was my third seat assignment as Air Canada changed aircraft and I had to complain to Customer Service (aka ‘Support’) via the CEO to get back to a window seat. The included food choices were omelette or French toast. Cabin crew asked if I wanted bread with my toast. Huh? No maple syrup but a sweet red goop with diced apple chunks. Who chooses this stuff? Ya, I know, first world problem. Return Vancouver-Ottawa flight 342 left from gate C45 which for the mathematically challenged YVR management is after gate C46. Mid-morning departure with the usual ongoing announcements about a full flight, limited space, free hand luggage check (isn’t carry-on free to begin with?), and then some little old lady handling out luggage stickers for carry-ons. No thanks. Had the omelette on the return flight. Took the bread. During this flight the primary cabin crew member disappeared for long periods of time “behind the curtain” and had trouble coordinating her duties. Air Canada has become the bottom feeder among the “charge more, provide less” carriers. Talk about ‘skimp-flation’.

More like custom officers than nice airline hosts. The constant delays, I understand for safety reasons but every time? How can that be possible. Seems more like other reasons for the sluggish performance. Other airlines I flown all over the world seem far more pleasant, quick and efficient 9/10 times. We also waited to board today after 3 delays. We were next to board and they said we were zone 4 not 3 and to go back of the line even though our connecting flight tickets had no zoned listed. So we thought it was 3 and the other line has zone 3 and 4 passing into zone 2. The person at the front basically tried to embarrass us and said that’s the rules. Back of the line. Then literally 1 second later, he said now boarding zone 4. So seemed a little rude to do that to us. His counterpart was kind enough to board us after and apologize for how he treated us which helped us at least laugh about it but I honestly think some serious training, or incentive or something is needed to make the staff nicer to work with.

Today (Friday) I received an email from FEDEX (not Air Canada) advising me they would deliver a package to me on Monday (my bag I assume)! So Air Canada finally found my luggage and instead of loading it onto the next available flight and getting it to me this evening, they have offloaded it to FEDEX, who will truck it here over the weekend. I've been 6 days without my clothes and (even though my luggage was located at 3:00pm on Friday), I now have to wait another three days. Air Canada say they'll repay 'reasonable expenses' for a delayed bag, but won't tell me what this is. So I've had to purchase new outfits every second day, with no guarantee my unnecessary spending will be refunded. Furthermore, do I throw my new clothes into the bin, when I fly back to Australia next Saturday? Because I'll now be over my baggage limit.

"✅Trip Verified| Remarkably poor customer service..... Our initial flight was delayed out of Boston for a ""safety"" reason, what I have gathered is that this is what they tell you so that it can not be their fault. We landed in Montreal and when we got off the plane, were handed ticket changes to give us a 3 hour delay in Montreal, send us to Portugal and give us another layover there before heading to Milan (adding roughly 7 hours to our travel and making us miss everything we had planned and already paid for in Milan). We got to the gate of our initial flight on time and tried to get our seats, but they had been sold to someone else as we were removed from the flight. We waited for the new connection and got to Portugal. In Portugal we were told by Air Canada that we could not get on the flight as we did not have boarding passes and they could not give us boarding passes because we had not paid for our baggage. I showed them the receipts and was told that there was nothing they could do and they could not even open it up for us to pay a second time. The Air Canada people had me take all of our passports and go out through the exit, find the check in area for Air Canada and get help there since we were short on time as it took an hour just to get this far in trying to get our boarding passes. I ran the 20 minutes to get to check in only to be told that they could also not help me and it was not their problem so I needed to call Air Canada, they did not give me a number or anything just told me it was not their problem and that I needed to call and was pushed aside for the next person. I called the number I found online, only to be told that there was nothing they could do either. So here I am, stuck outside of security with no boarding passes to get back to my family and my family's passports. I was so frustrated that I cried. Finally some nice lady with a different airline helped me and took maybe 10 minutes to fix the issue and get me my boarding passes. By this time I had 40 minutes to get through security and to the gate. We made it, 0 thanks to Air Canada who was apparently content to leave us stranded in a country we shouldn't have been in to begin with as we made it to the gate of our initial connection to begin with. When I complained to Air Canada, explaining that we do not travel often (this was 4 years of saving) and just asked for the money back from what I had prepaid and missed, they told me that it was not their problem or responsibility but here is a $200 Air Canada voucher that you will never use. Their response to my rebuttal asking that they make this right and just refund me the roughly $500 in missed activities as they mishandled our flight from beginning to end, they told me ""While I am sorry and understand your disappointment with our decision, our response is in line with the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. Although this may not be the answer you are looking for, I thank you for your understanding and appreciate this final opportunity to reply to your concerns."" AKA it's okay for us to re-route you, make you miss everything you had planned, and not even bother to make sure you could get on the extra 7 hours of travel we put you on.

"✅Trip Verified|  Terrible service. My transit was in Toronto and Fuel stop in London. I had two checked luggages and 1 dog in hold/excess baggage. First in Toronto, the airport staff for Air Canada was so rude as I just asked them if my dog is there in hold. Especially the supervisor was extremely arrogant and rude with his responses and did not provide any information. Upon arriving at London I got a message saying my both checked luggages are missing. I was so afraid that they left my dog back, I again reached with the ground staff in London who assured me my dog is there but both my checked luggage’s are not there. I reached Mumbai and the Air Canada ground staff told me that I don’t have to worry about anything and they will ship me both of my luggage’s within 3 days. They also provided me with a phone number to reach them back. After all this once everybody took their bags from the belt, they brought my dog out. They did not fill his food neither his water throughout the journey- which I expected that they may do it in Toronto (2 hrs stoppage) and London (3 hours stoppage). Yesterday on November 5th I received one of my backpack which I checked in and unfortunately my main 23kg suitcase did not arrive. I tried calling the number ground staff at Mumbai gave me but no answer, I called like 50 times but no answer. Im so upset with the service as the bag had very important and very valuable things in it. The upsetting thing is I got dog food for my dog for the initial 30 days and my dog couldn’t eat his food because of this error of losing my bag! I don’t have any clue where my bag is what is happening, even if I will get my bag or not, what about the amount of goods that were in the bag, who will reimburse! It’s very upsetting and I would request everyone to never take Air Canada. Very terrible service and very frustrating and very expensive experience.

I am missing a very important medical appointment because of this which has been pre-booked months in advance and on top of that I will be charged for this because it's less than 24 hours notice! I booked this flight with additional 2 hours to spare upon my return but even that isn't enough! This is insanity and with zero action. There is no other flight that would get me home on time, and all I was offered was apologies! This is wasting my whole day now since I'm forced to sit and just wait like an idiot.

"Not Verified| Air Canada staff is generally very rude. I went to their Boarding gate and I was in transit at Frankfurt airport to request if I can be put on standby for an earlier flight which was to depart In 1hr (my connecting flight was in 5hrs), and she directed me to customer service counter, which was closed. I went back to the counter to tell her that it was closed and she said yes I know but that’s where you have to go. From my past experience at Frankfurt, and other airlines, I know it is possible for the staff to help out but this lady was just plain rude. I don’t think they appreciate their customers and also the fact on how happy it makes person travelling 24hrs if someone is just polite, forget even helping him which is by far too much to ask from Air Canada employees.",air canada staff gener rude went board gate transit frankfurt airport request put standbi earlier flight depart hr connect flight hr direct custom servic counter close went back counter tell close said ye know go past experi frankfurt airlin know possibl staff help ladi plain rude think appreci custom also fact happi make person travel hr someon polit forget even help far much ask air canada employe

"✅Trip Verified| My experience with Air Canada was nothing short of a complete disaster. I wouldn't wish this airline on my worst enemy. To start, our departure was delayed by a mind-boggling two hours, and the reason? Apparently, the gate wasn't even available. So there we sat, like cattle, twiddling our thumbs, and wondering if this was some kind of cruel joke. But oh, the delays didn't stop there. No, they continued throughout the flight. It was as if Air Canada had a personal vendetta against punctuality. The flight attendants must have thought they were on vacation too, as they seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than addressing the frustrated passengers. I'd like to say that the in-flight experience made up for it, but that would be a lie. The seats were about as comfortable as a park bench, and the in-flight entertainment was laughable at best. It's safe to say that my next flight won't be booked with Air Canada.

"✅Trip Verified| Travel from LAX to Barcelona and back, there were 4 legs on Air Canada (LAX to Toronto to Barcelona and back).

On-board and airport staff were nice and the process appeared efficient on check in and on-board. Given the repeated delays and resulting excessive travel time and missing bags, I will do everything I can to avoid traveling with Air Canada as a result of this experience. 100% NOT on time and lost (""delayed"") bags is unacceptable.

"Not Verified|  My flight was an absolute mess. I went from Quebec City to Montreal then to IAD. My first flight was delayed 3 times (with the email service giving me a heart attack by saying my flight is about to leave and then that my other flight had already left) before being cancelled. They wanted to stick me on a flight the next day. I'm a broke, disabled person. I couldn't afford another night in the City, and my cat sitter couldn't do another visit. So, I managed to get moved to a much later flight (I had been set to leave at 9 am, so I got to the airport at 6, and my new flight with a different airline was set for 4 pm). I finally make it to Montreal (thankfully nothing went wrong with this other airline, besides me having to re-check my luggage in) and things go from bad to worse. I mentioned that I'm disabled, I needed the wheelchair assistance, so they come get me, and I'm taken to the service desk (while being bumped into things and people along the way, it's not a great airport for people who need the assistance). When we get there, I find out that the person who set up this new flight had sent me to an airport 2 hours from my home. My normal airport is still 30 minutes away, but I certainly couldn't afford an Uber from this new one. So I say that, and I get blank stares. Thankfully I was able to get shifted to a new flight (yet again, and this one I did kind of miss due to the next issue) but they set me under this really hot light and left me to wait next to this guy's desk. I saw him get through 2 groups of people, the second set telling him that he needed to help me. I had been sitting there for 20-30 minutes at that point. (I had planned to ask what was happening after these kind ladies were done with him) So he says all of a sudden that the guy who should have come for me was stuck on a plane. Which, okay, I get that things happen, but why was I just sitting there when there surely must be more than one person who could have helped me? This guy takes me himself, and then I get left in a hallway with about 10 other people (many of them seemed to also be using assistance) who had had their passports taken to print off their boarding cards and hadn't seen or heard anything since. At this point, my boarding time has come and gone. I'm almost certain I have missed this flight and am more than ready to start crying in pure frustration. Then he finally reappears, gives the people their passports and boarding cards and we continue on our journey. I finally get to the plane (which was miraculously still there) and board (and am super thirsty at this point. Being stuck under that light as well as not having had an opportunity to get anything was really messing with me) and finally start the last leg home. I was freezing, but there weren't any blankets on a short haul, which, fair enough. But I was finally able to get home, much later than my original 2 pm arrival time. Never again.

"✅Trip Verified| A very typical Air Canada transatlantic experience: good enough, but nothing to write home about. The older B777s with 10-abreast seating are not quite as good as Air Canada's newer Dreamliners, but seat comfort is adequate for a 7-hour flight. In-flight entertainment is decent and quality of main meal is actually quite good. Cabin crew service was fine too. Pre-landing ""breakfast"" is really disappointing: just a tiny cheap croissant and yoghurt. I don't understand why airlines like Air Canada don't make a bit more effort with pre-landing food offerings. It really would not take much effort or expense to offer a proper snack box instead, and such a small improvement would go a long way to leaving passengers with a more favourable impression of the airline's service. The online check-in process on Air Canada nowadays is cumbersome: in addition to the usual things, you have to enter your passport details and credit card details to pay for a checked-in suitcase (who travels transatlantic without a suitcase anyway?). For some reason you can't do this ahead of travelling anymore. And you have to do it again when checking in for the return flight. Passengers normally know their passport details and how many bags they intend to check in well ahead of travelling, so entering all this information during the check-in process is stressful, particularly when you are abroad for the return flight. With just an improved pre-landing meal and check-in process, Air Canada would definitely be one of my preferred airlines.",typic air canada transatlant experi good enough noth write home older b abreast seat quit good air canada newer dreamlin seat comfort adequ hour flight flight entertain decent qualiti main meal actual quit good cabin crew servic fine pre land breakfast realli disappoint tini cheap croissant yoghurt understand airlin like air canada make bit effort pre land food offer realli would take much effort expens offer proper snack box instead small improv would go long way leav passeng favour impress airlin servic onlin check process air canada nowaday cumbersom addit usual thing enter passport detail credit card detail pay check suitcas travel transatlant without suitcas anyway reason ahead travel anymor check return flight passeng normal know passport detail mani bag intend check well ahead travel enter inform check process stress particularli abroad return flight improv pre land meal check process air canada would definit one prefer airlin

"✅Trip Verified| Air Canada should be embarrassed for their truly terrible experience. Every interaction I experienced with them was the worst, most unprofessional service I have received. We were to fly from Seattle to Montreal then to Barcelona. We arrived to the airport at 5AM for our flight and it was to leave at 7:50AM. At 7:30AM they started boarding and then promptly stopped due to a ""mechanical issue"" They delayed the flight by 30minutes, then an hour, then another hour, then 4 hours, finally at 1:30PM they announced cancellation. Through out the delay process, the AC employees would abandon their gate instead of helping answer questions or help us rebook our connecting flights that we were missing. When they were there they would say ""we can't talk about that flight until X time"" Every time they announced a new delay, we waited in long lines to get service and rebook our connections over and over again. We spent 30 minutes waiting in a line, only for everyone to find out this was just a line for food vouchers! The manager said ""I made an announcement about what line to stand in"" but no one heard it. People were crying and fighting in line! The AC customers were actually doing more of the communication than the AC employees were. Further more, the food vouchers we were provided would not be accepted by any of the airport restaurants because there was no number to enter into a POS system to close out the sale. Once the flight was cancelled we were told by the gate manager that we would receive $700 in compensation per ticket for the delay. AC rebooked us on a flight with an 8 hour lay over in Dublin. In total, our delay was 15 hours to our final destination in Europe. This delay could have been much shorter had AC cancelled the flight hours earlier and rebooked us all appropriately. When I got home, I filled out a claim for this compensation that was promised to us. It said AC would take 30 days to review it. Less than 24 hours later, I'm already denied. So, I called the customer service line who told me he would escalate to management and I would receive a supervisor call by 9/1. I kid you not, 1 HOUR later I get an email saying that my claim is still denied but they would offer me a $300 credit. Furthermore they did not address my issue about the fact that I had not received my $200 refund for seat selections on the cancelled flight that never occurred. I replied to the email and asked them to please call me. I call again a few days later and a rep tells me that it's protocol to email first and that they will still call. She said to reply to the email and I'll get a supervisor call soon. Finally after 3 weeks and no replies, I call again and speak with a customer service rep who now tells me that customer relations doesn't take phone calls and that both of the other reps have misspoken. I asked how I can speak to a manager about this and she said that I can't because they consider my claim closed. She said she was the highest rep I could talk to even though she claimed she was a ""reservation agent"" I told her this was unethical customer service and totally unreasonable.

"Not Verified| I booked a flight from Cancun to Calgary in early August 2023 using Aeroplan points. Yesterday, I received notification that my flight was changed from a direct flight in business class on Nov. 16th to a one-stop flight, in economy class on Nov. 17th. There was no specific reason given (though unforeseen conditions were mentioned). This is unacceptable. I expect, under these circumstances, to be booked with another airline, which had a direct flight that was perfect for my itinerary. So, I called Air Canada and, after a 4-hour wait, was told that I couldn't address the issue because it was an Aeroplan issue. Unacceptable, even if at the corporate level they are distinct. I was ""connected' with Aeroplan. After a one-hour wait I gave up. There was, at that time, no ""call back"" option. Next morning, I tried again before sunrise. The automated system was cumbersome and of poor fidelity. I was rejected once. Tried again. This time, I at least had a ""call back"" option. So, as has been the case in the past, I would rate Air Canada as agonizingly bad when it comes to resolving flight issues.",book flight cancun calgari earli august use aeroplan point yesterday receiv notif flight chang direct flight busi class nov th one stop flight economi class nov th specif reason given though unforeseen condit mention unaccept expect circumst book anoth airlin direct flight perfect itinerari call air canada hour wait told address issu aeroplan issu unaccept even corpor level distinct connect aeroplan one hour wait gave time call back option next morn tri sunris autom system cumbersom poor fidel reject tri time least call back option case past would rate air canada agonizingli bad come resolv flight issu

"✅Trip Verified| Had a terrible experience with AC that *could* have been a very positive experience if AC had even an ounce of humanity in them. Very disappointed and feel cheated on behalf of my parents. Here's the summary: - my parents flew from Toronto to Zurich (Switzerland) with AC at the end of April this year to visit me. They are on the older side (my Mom is 79, my Dad is 82) but physically still OK. So far, so good. - they wanted to fly back to Toronto on May 5 on flight LX4640 (operated by AC, although Swiss was somehow also involved). They made it past airport security in Zurich and got onto a crowded shuttle train. After getting off, they ended up on a crowded escalator going up. Halfway up the escalator, my Mom was shoved (accidentally) by someone just ahead of her. She lost her balance (there was no room to move her feet) and fell backwards onto my Dad, who also couldn't brace himself on time, and he fell too. Both got bumped and bruised, but my Mom hit her head on an escalator step and was bleeding. Both were helped by other passengers and then airport staff. My Mom got a bandage around her head. Neither of them lost consciousness (they got lucky in a way). Perhaps unthoughtfully, my parents felt fine and wanted to continue to the plane. However, understandably, the airport staff told them that there was no way the captain would let them fly. So instead, they were taken to a hospital in the city by ambulance for check-ups. A few hours later, the doctors had cleared them of serious injuries and they were allowed to fly again (see photo of my mom's injuries). Here's where it gets really nasty. They had ""non-refundable"" tickets (unfortunately bought through expedia), and expedia claimed they couldn't get them onto the next flight the following day - Air Canada is responsible. But AC told me (on the phone) that they couldn't do anything either. They confirmed this later in a couple of emails, basically saying, ""haha, we are not legally obligated to help you. You got unlucky. Bye!"" Here's the kicker: to get back to Toronto, we had to buy 1-way tickets from Zurich to Toronto, which cost them a fortune: $3000 for the both of them for the next day! For the record, this was *much* more than the 2-way tickets they'd already long ago paid for. Since then, we inquired at various insurances and legal services, and nobody seemed able to help...the circumstances were unusual and my parents got unlucky. In other words: - because my parents experienced an accident at the airport that led to them being denied boarding, they were forced to pay $3000 extra out of pocket to get home. What kills me is that AC had free seats on the flight the next day! Imagine how the story could have gone: AC would tell them ""Wow, you guys had a tough break, I'm sure glad you turned out to be OK! - and of course we'll get you back home tomorrow...there are still seats free."" We would have loved AC from that day on. That would have made everyone happy. And keep in mind: Nobody was asking for a ""refund"" - they just wanted to use their paid-for ticket to get home!! Now tell me, is this fair? That on top of the suffering they had thanks to the accident, they *also* have to shell out $3000 more to get home - just so AC can get richer and profit from the bad situation?

"✅Trip Verified|  Their web page froze a half dozen times when trying to book two trips. At seat selection, could not proceed and had to re-enter the data including our Global Entry numbers 5-6 times. Finally gave up and called for a phone reservation. Took me over five days to reach someone after one hour waits every day. Phone agent was pleasant. Flight from SFO was slightly delayed but we made our connection. Plane was the most uncomfortable, food basic. No entertainment. Returning from Kelowna unable to check in on line because the web site malfunctioned. I was able to use the phone app to check in. At Kelowna airport advised by text that the Vancouver-SFO leg was canceled by United. No way to get assistance for rebooking. Phones and text for UAL unanswered. No UAL staff at Kelowna and overwhelmed in Vancouver. Finally got a friend in the US with million mile status at UAL to get us a flight the next day via Portland-SFO. Went to gate agent in Kelowna and asked to get boarding passes. Told they were not valid flights nor confirmation numbers. He didn't realize being a code share he should look at UAL and not just AC. Then AC had the audacity to send us a satisfaction survey after our trip and while filling out the detailed survey that site malfunctioned and I couldn't send it. We had a business class flight in Sept to the Maritime provinces and we just couldn't stomach flying with AC again so we canceled the flight. Tried to do it on the web site, unable to because you need the original cc information including CVV which I did not have because during the BC trip Chase canceled my card for perceived fraudulent activity and when I received the new card I had mailed back the old one. Chase was surprised that AC required such detailed information when I called unsuccessfully to get the CVV from Chase but they have no access to that info either. Had to call AC again and was prepared to wait hours but to my surprise a charming French accented phone agent answered within 10 minutes. She took care of things efficiently. Since she was the first human being I've been able to contact at AC I outlined my litany of bad experiences and she offered me a 20% off coupon for another flight.

"✅Trip Verified| I travelled as a family with my two toddlers. Seats were comfortable, Entertainment was OK and had plenty of options for kids. However since they do Code share with Sri Lankan airlines there were lot of Sri Lankan passengers on the flight. But there were no Sri Lankan films or dramas available (almost all Middle Eastern Carriers do have). Cabin Staff was not friendly at all. (they are always like that in Air Canada). Though I did not experience personally on this flight, I saw the staff was talking very rude to elderly passengers from India and many South Asian origin. Food is again OK. I don't have a complain for that. Getting out and Immigration is very smooth at Toronto Airport. Summary - since we do not have much transatlantic connections to travel to Sri Lanka, I may book again with air Canada + Sri Lankan.

"Not Verified|  I flew from Toronto Pearson to Europe, with a connecting flight through Munich. The plane left Toronto with a significant delay, first it was announced that a fridge had broken and they were waiting for ice to be brought to the plane, then 20-something minutes later they announced that some other gate was missing a tow bar and it had to be borrowed from our gate, so they were waiting for it to be returned. This of course caused many to miss their connecting flights or barely make it, I luckily made it. And they failed to load my luggage on the plane! I arrived at my destination the following day, waited at the belt, only to realize that my luggage hadn't made it. I of course assumed that because of the delay from Toronto, there wasn't enough time for my luggage to be transfered to the next plane and that it remained in Munich. After filing the complaint at the destination airport, I received an email that my luggage was still in Toronto! I guess it's a good thing that they located it, but why is my luggage travelling on its own 24 hours after I did? Gross incompetence, I don't know what's happening but it's like nobody knows how to do their jobs properly anymore! And here I am, a day into my vacation, with no clothes, no toiletries, no medication other than what I had in my carryon, waiting to hear where my luggage is and when I can go retrieve it. Which retrieval, by the way, is very costly, as obviously I don't have a car here so I have to take an Uber or taxi, and where I'm staying is far from the airport so now I have to spend a ton extra thanks to Air Canada's incompetence.",flew toronto pearson europ connect flight munich plane left toronto signific delay first announc fridg broken wait ice brought plane someth minut later announc gate miss tow bar borrow gate wait return cours caus mani miss connect flight bare make luckili made fail load luggag plane arriv destin follow day wait belt realiz luggag made cours assum delay toronto enough time luggag transfer next plane remain munich file complaint destin airport receiv email luggag still toronto guess good thing locat luggag travel hour gross incompet know happen like nobodi know job properli anymor day vacat cloth toiletri medic carryon wait hear luggag go retriev retriev way costli obvious car take uber taxi stay far airport spend ton extra thank air canada incompet

"Not Verified|  We left YYZ on August 13th, 2023 to spend 12 days in Bahamas. My luggage never showed up at the airport in Bahamas. We are now 8 days into our vacation and I still don't have my luggage. I have all my clothes in there and my baby clothes. I was told 7 suitcases went missing off that flight. I don't understand how such a big airline can loose suitcases and where do all these lost suitcases end up? Is there some sort of theft ring going on that everyone is just ignoring? I have filed 2 different reports and Air Canada still hasn't been able to locate my bag.

"✅Trip Verified| We were originally booked premium economy travel from Japan to Boston with a layover in Montreal. Our flight from Montreal to Boston was canceled due to mechanical issues at about 10:45 pm. The staff told all passengers to find hotels for the evening, that these costs would be reimbursed, and that we would all be booked on new flights. As I needed to be at work the next day, when we got to our hotel that evening, I tried calling Air Canada and was on hold awaiting assistance from 11:30 pm to 1:45 am. At that point, I hung up and went to bed. When we woke in the morning, Air Canada had booked us on a flight for Friday afternoon rather than that day which was Thursday. We needed to get home, and saw that there were three business class seats available on the 8:15am flight that day, and thus grabbed those flights. As we were booked on premium economy, I believe that had we been successful in getting to speak with an agent, then Air Canada would have responded by putting us in those seats in order to get us home. However, Air Canada has refused to refund us for this flight. The fact that they would have made us stay an additional day and a half in Montreal when they had 3 seats available, is beyond my understanding and reflects no consideration for customer service. I have reached out to Air Canada three times now, and they still refused. It is also worth noting that on our way to Japan we were also delayed three hours. However their unwillingness to enable us to use available seats after canceling our flight was just unbelievable.",origin book premium economi travel japan boston layov montreal flight montreal boston cancel due mechan issu pm staff told passeng find hotel even cost would reimburs would book new flight need work next day got hotel even tri call air canada hold await assist pm point hung went bed woke morn air canada book us flight friday afternoon rather day thursday need get home saw three busi class seat avail flight day thu grab flight book premium economi believ success get speak agent air canada would respond put us seat order get us home howev air canada refus refund us flight fact would made us stay addit day half montreal seat avail beyond understand reflect consider custom servic reach air canada three time still refus also worth note way japan also delay three hour howev unwilling enabl us use avail seat cancel flight unbeliev

"✅Trip Verified|  On a flight to LAX - AC785 they lost my luggage, and turned out they never loaded my luggage on the same plane. While waiting for boarding, they were taking volunteers to check-in their carry ons. As not enough passengers volunteered, Air Canada staffs forced passengers to check-in the carry ons last minute. For my delayed luggage, they did not give me any notice of being delayed and could not locate it, only advised it was never loaded on the flight. Received my luggage the next day evening, had to delay all my travel plans as I had to pick up my luggage from the airport again. On the flight back to YYZ, flight was delayed 15 minutes due to security issue and when we landed at 7:35PM, luggage was delayed by 2 hours and 30 minutes.

"✅Trip Verified|  Do not fly Air Canada if you have a disabiiity. I emailed the airline in good faith over a month ahead of my flight explaining that I need an a seat (window seat, left side) on the flight for medical reasons. I have metal in my left leg and a spinal condition, and therefore on long haul flights, cope with sitting down for a long time, but shifting my entire body weight onto my left buttock and leaning against the plane wall on my left and taking my right buttock off the seat so I don't sit on my painful leg the whole time as it can lead to agnoising pain needing morphine drug treatment and leave me unable to walk for a few days. I use crutches. I have a permanant disability. I received an email back saying that the seat had been allocated and the disability assistance through the airport also. When checking in the night before, my boarding pass automatically assigned me a C seat, the aisle, where I'd have to get up each time the passengers in the window seat and aisle seat required the toilet (my crutches are typically locked away at the front of the plane by the staff); and this would cause me the problems described above. I spent a total of four hours until 1.30am the evening before a 9.00am flight from Scotland to Canada emailing and international-calling the medical desk at Air Canada trying to get the seat changed urgently as I wouldn't have been able to fly with the C seat, and would have missed my flight. For 3 hours 15 minutes, this change was refused by the agents who insisted they had allocated me the seat they thought was best for me (gobsmacked as they were not me or my doctor) who first told me that I could only be moved if another passenger agreed and the flight was full. And then I was told that the medical desk couldn't put this change through as the booking system had been passed over to the airport. I was then asked if I could bend my leg and then when outlining again the full list of medical conditions I live with permanantly, including a life threatening disease, the A seat was mysteriously allocated and apologies given. I was beside myself with tears and distress that despite the correct seat being allocated a month beforehand, I had gone through this distressing situation. Instead of 7 hours sleep, I got 3 hours before I had to travel to the Airport. I live with chronic fatigue following a stroke last year and this has not helped me at all. Sadly I have further flights booked on this trip with Air Canada but I will never fly with this Airline again in future. Disabled people are sick of being treated badly.

"✅Trip Verified|  For international passengers on domestic flights it is not comprehensible to pay extra for baggage and the prices are outrageous for an hour domestic flight. The term Basic Fair is a technical term used by Air Canada, it is not defined anywhere. One can imagine that one would have to pay extra for food or alcohol, but not for baggage below the 23 kg limit. Air Canada combines the characteristics of low-cost airlines such as EasyJet or Ryan Air by charging extra for baggage with those of premium airlines International passengers on domestic flights are therefore misled and ripped off and this from an airline that calls itself member of the Star Alliance.",intern passeng domest flight comprehens pay extra baggag price outrag hour domest flight term basic fair technic term use air canada defin anywher one imagin one would pay extra food alcohol baggag kg limit air canada combin characterist low cost airlin easyjet ryan air charg extra baggag premium airlin intern passeng domest flight therefor misl rip airlin call member star allianc
"✅Trip Verified| Air Canada is one of the worst airlines I have ever traveled with. I fly at least 5 to 6 times a year (including going overseas to Europe) and I have never taken a flights where a delay cause my flight to not be rescheduled until 3 days later! I was traveling with friends coming back from Calgary and going to Columbus OH. We had a 1 year old with us. Our flight from Calgary to Toronto had 2+ hr delay and was causing us to miss our connection. They could not find alternative flights for 2 days and when we decided to go to Toronto since that is driving distance (6hr) to Columbus our flight from Toronto to Columbus was not for another 2 days. The airline got us a hotel and a $15 food voucher TOTAL. We decided to rent a car that night and drive home. When we attempted to get any sort of compensation (car rental reimbursement or reimbursement for the flight not used) it has been almost impossible to get a hold of Air Canada (they don't actually have customer service that will help with this on the phone it is all online) 1 month later all my complaints have been rejected, we can't get reimbursed for the rental and I want to make sure Air Canada stops being a horrible business impacting people's lives like they are.

I was amazed to be honest. What I am used to in today's world is being left behind. Left in the cold, forgotten and left behind, and a sea of red tape; the opposite is what I experienced. I was amazed at A.C.'s proactively and professionally taking responsibility, which is not what I'm used to. What I'm used to is indifference and let's hope we get away with it. I'm just a lay dude with a modest income and no connection to any airline. What's more, A.C. is telling me I may be entitled to compensation. I can't believe it.

This passenger was seated next to me in an aisle seat and was ignored and treated rudely by an attendant, who had to be called back to assist the wheelchair passenger to the toilet. My row was missed for beverage service after the first meal service. When the request for flight attendant was activated, it took nearly half an hour for someone to come-by but it was for collecting the meal trays and trash. The flight attendant who skipped us on the beverage service didn’t apologize but took the beverage request and went on to collect trash and then decided to go and grab the beverage and returned with a cup and a can of beverage.

The seats in economy are uncomfortable and everything looks a bit bashed up and scruffy. Flight was delayed for 1hr 45 mins due to technical issues. Crew were a mixed bag, some were wonderful some were edging towards unprofessional in terms of behaviour talking about inappropriate things around passengers.

"✅Trip Verified| We were traveling from Athens, Greece to Austin, TX with Air Canada. We had three flights to get home (ATH-YUL, YUL-IAH, IAH-AUS). Both our first two flights were delayed. Unfortunately, our second flight was delayed by 1.5 hours which made it impossible to catch our 3rd flight to get to Austin. We had 15' to get from Terminal A to Terminal E and surprisingly, the agent at the gate did not bother (although we asked) to inform the next gate that we were on our way. As a result, we missed the connection by a few minutes (in spite of running across the airport after two long flights and with tired little kids) and were left stranded in Houston. Due to the late hour, there were also no Air Canada agents anymore to assist us with vouchers. We paid out of pocket to stay at a hotel and get to Austin. Even the next day, the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours. Air Canada did not reimburse us for anything because the delays were under 3 hours. We got a standard email reply. In total, flying with Air Canada was a bad experience. Delays, lack of coordination, miscommunication were a few of the things that went wrong. People were friendly but ineffective and inefficient.

"✅Trip Verified| I have flown Air Canada for 39 years. Unfortunately, my last flight on Air Canada took place on July 17th, 2023. My 10 year old son and I, traveling from Seattle to Toronto boarded the plane at 10.50pm for a four and a half hour red eye. As my son likes to sit in the window seat, he entered the aisle first and sat down as I arranged our carry-on’s. We landed in Toronto at approximately 6.20am. As we got up from our seats I gave way for my son to stand in the aisle to stretch him legs. I looked around our seats to confirm that we had everything. I was absolutely horrified, disgusted, nauseated and upset when I looked at my sons seat only to see the seat, seatbelt, and seatbelt hardware covered in a significant amount of dry blood. I brought this to the attention of both the pilot and crew as we were exiting the plane. It was suggested that I speak with the Air Canada agent at the gate, but there were none. I then tried to locate customer service within in the airport, only to be told that my only option was to call the number posted online. I did submit a complaint to their customer service department, it’s been over two weeks and I have yet to receive a response. In addition I submitted a complaint to Mr. Rousseau, only to hear back from R.A. (Al) Read, Vice President, Airports – North America. His response was disappointing at best. He stated if there were a medical incident on board the crew are trained to manage in. He also started the aircraft’s are groomed and seatbelts are crossed prior to each flight, which is absolutely false. A blood covered seat clearly proves this as inaccurate. He also said that since 10 days had past, from my email to him, it’s difficult to analyse the situation. Again, I immediately reported the blood covered seat to the both the crew and pilot, upon exiting the plane, as well as informed customer service thought their site, with no response. There was no solution provided, or action based response. I will never fly Air Canada again, and would discourage everyone else from doing so.",flown air canada year unfortun last flight air canada took place juli th year old son travel seattl toronto board plane pm four half hour red eye son like sit window seat enter aisl first sat arrang carri land toronto approxim got seat gave way son stand aisl stretch leg look around seat confirm everyth absolut horrifi disgust nauseat upset look son seat see seat seatbelt seatbelt hardwar cover signific amount dri blood brought attent pilot crew exit plane suggest speak air canada agent gate none tri locat custom servic within airport told option call number post onlin submit complaint custom servic depart two week yet receiv respons addit submit complaint mr rousseau hear back r al read vice presid airport north america respons disappoint best state medic incid board crew train manag also start aircraft groom seatbelt cross prior flight absolut fals blood cover seat clearli prove inaccur also said sinc day past email difficult analys situat immedi report blood cover seat crew pilot upon exit plane well inform custom servic thought site respons solut provid action base respons never fli air canada would discourag everyon els
"✅Trip Verified| Worst airline experience ever. First off the web site malfunctioned a half dozen times trying to book the flight. After entering all information (including known traveler number) at the seat selection stage the web site froze. Tried to book by phone. It took me 5 days waiting for over an hour each day to reach a phone agent. Finally got the flights booked but the agent would not take my Global Entry number over the phone, said I could add it at check-in. Got the notice to check in on June 25 and you guessed it. On-line check in malfunctioned. Had to check in using the phone app. Then had to wait again for hours to reach someone on the phone to add the known traveler numbers to get TSA pre-check outbound and Global Entry on return flight back to US. Flight was the most uncomfortable seats we've experienced in decades. Food/drink minimal. Return flight code shared with UAL was canceled, we were notified via text as we waited in Kelowna airport. Unable to reach anyone on UAL via text or phone (as suggested in the text) and no one from AC was able to help us at the airport. Finally reached a friend in the US who has million mile status and he was able to reach someone at UAL and got us booked Vancouver/Portland/San Francisco the next day. With that confirmation number and flight numbers I asked the agent at the Vancouver airport to give us boarding passes. He stated that was not a valid confirmation number nor flight numbers. Called my friend again, he told us they were valid (turns out the AC staff didn't look under code shares) but was able to get us rebooked the next day direct Vancouver/San Francisco. Asked for a hotel voucher at Vancouver for our overnight stay at the Vancouver airport hotel (the Fairmont), told would not give us one but to request it on line when we got back home. Have now found out that failure to give us the voucher violated Canadian air line rules. From A-Z Air Canada was a failure. Web sites don't function for booking or check-in. Phones are not answered for hours and hours spread over days. Emails and web site forms sent later go unanswered or with a rote ""it may take 45 days to respond"". Fortunately knowing the carry on bag problems with AC (inconsistent application of rules by gate staff) and flying economy (we usually fly business class) we didn't face the lost baggage problems everyone else is complaining about because we used non-roller bag soft sided luggage we had used for a trip to Africa where baggage limits are very strict as the planes get smaller and smaller. Unfortunately we booked another trip to Canada in September which is business class to the Quebec and Maritime provinces. We are dreading this trip and really regret booking on Air Canada.

"✅Trip Verified|  The flight was the first leg of 3 hops for us. We were supposed to board our flight to Toronto at 10:15am. The flight was delayed due to the plane being held up for some reason on the last flight. Air Canada kept giving us excuses. First delayed to 11am then 12pm then 2pm so on and so on until it was 8pm. By then we had rescheduled all of our connecting flights and lay over stays based on Air Canadas projected departure that night. They had our plane waiting outside our gate but decided it was too hot to board. Another two hours to trying to cool the plane down. Then they decided they were going to use another plane that was arriving. Then finally at 10:45pm they announced the flights cancelation due to the plane being too hot and no ground crew available to prep the other plane. After all of us waited for them for 12 hrs in the terminal. As a kicker, they refused to reimburse any of the passengers for hotel or additional transportation because according to them it was a ""weather related"" delay despite it wasn't weather related until several hours after the initial cause.

When we landed at Toronto, they had not gate for us to deplane at. We had to sit for 45 min in the plane while a ladder truck was found and buses could be rounded up. On the return leg, we had three gate changes and another flight delay of unknown duration.

"Not Verified| Flight initially delayed an hour, boarded, got settled in, only for the flight to be cancelled due to weather, which is understandable. What I couldn’t believe was the utter lack of preparation/knowledge/compassion from every single staff member from the moment we exited the aircraft after the cancellation. No direction on what steps need to be taken to rebook or receive a refund, staff at the airport said they do not deal with rebooking or reservations and told us to call customer service, only for customer service to tell us to sort it out at the airport. Also the phone station we were directed to seemed to be more of a holding pen for customers that Air Canada staff couldn’t be bothered helping. After years of flying with Air Canada I will never be flying with them again, as I don’t feel comfortable hinging the enjoyment of a holiday on this airlines outrageous incompetence.

"Not Verified|  When I tried to check in for my flight online, I found Air Canada completely changed the details of my flight, and didn't notify me. The new flight that was forced on me was so bad, that there was no way I could just accept it. After a long wait on the line, the airline representative (who didn't even offer an apology, let alone a compensation), said the only thing he could do was to rebook the flight to a later date, or give me a refund. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, he said there were no supervisors.  I had no choice but to rebook the flight, with all the inconveniences attached to it. Then the rude representative just hung up on me mid-call, so I had to call back and wait forever again just to verify that the details of the new flight were indeed finalized.

Everyone deplanes, we wait in 2 separate lines for over an hour before getting to counter...Air Canada rep rudely says they don't do rebooking at the counter, but here's a taxi and hotel voucher (for 1 night - we were stranded for 3!) every other air carrier does their very best to reroute passengers at the gate, Air Canada basically said shove it! Then waited on hold (at # AC rep gave us 'here, call this # and they will solve all your problems') for over 2 hours before AC rep came on line and said since tix were purchased through United, we needed to call them (4 hour wait time with United) phone reps zero help (we were suggesting alternative routes/cities, etc that they hadn't even considered) - we were stranded in Montreal through Sunday at an extra expense of over $1500 in hotel/food fees.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada Seattle to Comox was the worst flight of my life. In a short flight from Seattle to Comox with a connector in Vancouver. The connector is a 20 minute flight from Vancouver to Comox. I experienced 11, yes 11 delays and gate changes. A screen shot cannot show the frustration or physical pain caused by Air Canada's lacking. Running through large busy airports. Gate changes that required taking the tram in Seattle to different gates. Standing in lines of enraged customers to Information desks. All of us just trying to get to our destinations. It looked like a riot may ensue at the Vancouver airport in the Air Canada section. Employees that were trying hard, but also up against a behemoth company that seemed to care as little for them as they do for their customers. I kept apologizing to employees for expressing my frustration but I was never offered a manager to talk to. I was offered a card with numbers to call. I would not last a day as an employee for this company. I felt so bad for my fellow Canadians that have to work for a company that is so bad that they should not use the word Canada in their name. I could have made this travel by buses and ferry in about 10 hours. My travel by Air Canada with checkpoints and lines started in Seattle before 11am and ended more than 12 hours later.

"Not Verified|  Our flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by over 3 hours. No big deal. It happens. Toronto to Portland was another story. Because the connection was tight, Air Canada decided to bump us to a Toronto to Vancouver for an overnight, then onto Portland. They didn't bother to consult us; they just did it, without mentioning where we were expected to spend the night, or who would pay for it. When we arrived at Toronto our flight to PDX was also delayed. That made it possible to get back onto our original flight, but not without scrambling from the gate, to customer service, then racing back to the gate again. The customer service approved us for boarding our original flight. When we returned to the gate, the agent there questioned our permission to board. After grumbling about how the other agent had left him to do ""his"" job, he finally agreed to give us seats. We boarded, went to our assigned seats, then were told we couldn't sit there because they were crew seats. The gate guy had given us seats assigned for crew only. We had to dash around to find two seats. A kind passenger agreed to move so that we could sit together.  In the four-plus hour flight, no blanket, no pillow, no food unless you paid for it, no media, no magazines. Only a 2-beverage service. The seating was so tight. As expected, in the change from one flight to another, our bags didn't arrive with us. It was 10:30 at night. Not one Air Canada agent, either in lost luggage or ticketing was present at PDX. ""They go home at 9pm,"" we were told. So, we were unable to file a missing luggage report. This morning, I tried to go online to report our missing bags (Air Canada calls them ""delayed"" bags, not missing). It turns out that unless you've got a file number that's issued at the airport, you cannot use the online system; you must call a service number. I waited 34 minutes on the phone for an agent. When she answered, her accent was so strong that I had to ask her to repeat every question several times. I had to repeat my answers to her questions several times. She asked me for an ""original booking number"" that, according to her, was on my boarding pass. It was not. I checked it repeatedly. When I explained that I could not find it (I had my ticket number, my name, flight numbers, baggage tags...etc.), she hung up on me. I called again. I waited about 25 minutes on the second call. I politely explained that I could not understand him, and ended the call. Air Canada did text us.

"✅Trip Verified|  We had three bags checked with Air Canada and they lost all three. Tried many times to contact customer service but they kept me on hold for an average of 90 minutes, and the calls are farmed to another country, and it was sometimes impossible to understand the operators. I was able to go to the airport the next day and collect two of my three bags but the third one was lost. This was the important one with clothing and medications. I continued to call the lost baggage number four times (total hold time was 425 minutes) on July 5 and got different answers from each one as to the location of the bag. Tried calling Air Canada's front office, but they only respond to emails (I guess they are afraid to hear customers yell at them).

Not Verified|  We had a connecting flight from Toronto to Montreal after our flight from Rome and we waited over an hour for our luggage. There were 6 flights on the board and not one luggage came out. Our flight also was removed from the board and nothing showed up and we had very little help.

"✅Trip Verified| Frankfurt to Toronto was over 1 hour late arriving. Scheduled for 1915hrs actual was 2030hrs. Air Canada (AC) knew this would cause EVERY USA bound connecting flights to be missed because the US Customs would be closed before we could get off the plane. Not to mention the sheer distance between our gate and customs would require landing at least 15 minutes minimum before closing to even try to reach customs before closing. No announcement that we would be stuck in Toronto. No offer of assistance to get us re-booked on a flight after Customs opened again at 0410hrs the next day. No help desk at the airport that apparently CAN help us. 2030hrs When arriving at the closed US Customs the security guy said, ""we're closed. come back at 0430 when we reopen"" When I told him that we had connecting flights to catch, he said ""Welcome to Canada please go downstairs and go through Canada immigration."" I thought that meant we could go through that process and still make our flights, but turns out he was actually welcoming us to Canada as we were stuck there tonight and weren't going to make our connecting flight. We were actually told to talk to the person at the desk when you get off the elevator for additional information but that turned out to be a grumpy older man telling us he's not there to help anyone, just go through the line over there. Which was Canadian Customs and Immigration. Several flights were cancelled on the same night to the US. AC claimed would be handled automatically and notified via email about their new flights, but since my connecting flight still left as scheduled but without me or my family, it wasn't like that situation for us and we didn't get automatically rebooked for the next possible flights via email. Waited in the luggage location line for about 45 minutes about our luggage to be sure it wasn't going to the US without us. After learning the luggage was staying in Toronto, they said it would be safer to keep it in 'the system' and get the luggage assigned to your new flight and it will make it there. Otherwise it would take HOURS to locate and get them to us and we would have to check it back into the system anyways once we were rebooked. This was actually true in the end. We asked around for help and were directed by announcement to follow the ""connections"" signs to get help there. After waiting a while, that staff was clearly overwhelmed and actually started yelling at the customers about how they were NOT going to help anyone about rebooking or vouchers or anything. The line started getting very long when the staff started shouting over the public address, ""we are only two people here and we are not going to help anyone get rebooked, or hotel vouchers, or meal vouchers. You need to go upstairs where there are 15 people up there to help you. That turned out to be a lie. We followed the instructions, which ended up being the ticket counters on the departure floor, but eventually were yelled at again by a queen bee in charge stating that their only job is to help people check into their flights and since we didn't have any flights to board as our flight left without us, it was NOT their job to help us get rebooked. No remediation or assistance was given as to how we could resolve the situation either. I tried asking the special assistance table how I might get help and, after explaining our situation, she told us to go to the other area of ticketing counters for my spec",frankfurt toronto hour late arriv schedul hr actual hr air canada ac knew would caus everi usa bound connect flight miss us custom would close could get plane mention sheer distanc gate custom would requir land least minut minimum close even tri reach custom close announc would stuck toronto offer assist get us book flight custom open hr next day help desk airport appar help us hr arriv close us custom secur guy said close come back reopen told connect flight catch said welcom canada pleas go downstair go canada immigr thought meant could go process still make flight turn actual welcom us canada stuck tonight go make connect flight actual told talk person desk get elev addit inform turn grumpi older man tell us help anyon go line canadian custom immigr sever flight cancel night us ac claim would handl automat notifi via email new flight sinc connect flight still left schedul without famili like situat us get automat rebook next possibl flight via email wait luggag locat line minut luggag sure go us without us learn luggag stay toronto said would safer keep system get luggag assign new flight make otherwis would take hour locat get us would check back system anyway rebook actual true end ask around help direct announc follow connect sign get help wait staff clearli overwhelm actual start yell custom go help anyon rebook voucher anyth line start get long staff start shout public address two peopl go help anyon get rebook hotel voucher meal voucher need go upstair peopl help turn lie follow instruct end ticket counter departur floor eventu yell queen bee charg state job help peopl check flight sinc flight board flight left without us job help us get rebook remedi assist given could resolv situat either tri ask special assist tabl might get help explain situat told us go area ticket counter spec

"✅Trip Verified|  I purchased a ticket to fly Washington-Nairobi return in business class via Toronto, Frankfurt and Zurich late June/early July 2023. All flights but the first were code shares on other reputable carriers, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. I've had excellent experiences with Air Canada in the past and really looked forward to this family trip. Just before departure, Air Canada cancelled its flight from Washington because of staff shortages. I called Air Canada and, secured a satisfactory booking via Montreal. That was almost immediately cancelled, leaving me trying to call Air Canada support till around 4am. After multiple calls and hours on hold, I was booked on a United flight to Toronto connecting with Lufthansa on to Nairobi. When I arrived at Washington Dulles, United reported that AC had only made a booking, but had not reissued my ticket as required AC staff at the airport said they were only ramp agents, they couldn't sort out the problem. I had to call Air Canada customer support. Eventually, they called AC support, waited 45 minutes on hold, and then had the needed ticket issued. I thought, foolishly, that my problems were over. Alas, AC had only reissued an outbound ticket from Toronto to Nairobi, without replacing the original round trip ticket. When I arrived in Nairobi, my return flight had disappeared from the Lufthansa system on the grounds that I was a no-show for the outbound flight, leaving me stranded in Nairobi. After an entire night and half a day trying to reach Air Canada support, AC staff finally agreed to restore my return ticket. Reaching AC took about an hour and a half on hold on each occasion, and AC dropped most of these calls after a few minutes. Only on arrival at Nairobi airport did I realize that AC had bungled my return ticket, having me depart Frankfurt for Zurich before I arrived in Zurich. Fortunately, the Lufthansa staff in Nairobi were able to sort this out on departure. I understand hat it's tough running an airline right now, resurgent demand, staff and plane shortages, forest fires etc. But the AC system demands that clients call their agents way more than should be necessary. And, at the moment, ACs customer support lines are totally overwhelmed. Having to spend whole nights trying to get through to Air Canada support to deal with repeated errors made by Air Canada staff is totally unacceptable.",purchas ticket fli washington nairobi return busi class via toronto frankfurt zurich late june earli juli flight first code share reput carrier lufthansa swiss unit excel experi air canada past realli look forward famili trip departur air canada cancel flight washington staff shortag call air canada secur satisfactori book via montreal almost immedi cancel leav tri call air canada support till around multipl call hour hold book unit flight toronto connect lufthansa nairobi arriv washington dull unit report ac made book reissu ticket requir ac staff airport said ramp agent sort problem call air canada custom support eventu call ac support wait minut hold need ticket issu thought foolishli problem ala ac reissu outbound ticket toronto nairobi without replac origin round trip ticket arriv nairobi return flight disappear lufthansa system ground show outbound flight leav strand nairobi entir night half day tri reach air canada support ac staff final agre restor return ticket reach ac took hour half hold occas ac drop call minut arriv nairobi airport realiz ac bungl return ticket depart frankfurt zurich arriv zurich fortun lufthansa staff nairobi abl sort departur understand hat tough run airlin right resurg demand staff plane shortag forest fire etc ac system demand client call agent way necessari moment ac custom support line total overwhelm spend whole night tri get air canada support deal repeat error made air canada staff total unaccept
"✅Trip Verified|  Late departing Montreal which, according to the captain during an announcement, was because some meals still needed to be loaded on board. Chief Purser later told me that ""there are bunch of things that we didn't get today"" which means that us, the passengers, won't have those. Dinner service was a bit shambolic with the cabin crew in business class seeming uncoordinated and disjointed. My main course arrived barely warm, so I asked that it be heated up again. It returned quite some time later dried out. It certainly wasn't a meal I'd have expected in a premium cabin on a major carrier. What I have learned about this particular route is that the back of the business cabin is preferred by some customers who have their adult children sitting in the next cabin back (Premium Economy) such that the adult child can frequently come up to the business cabin to check on their elderly parent. I met a Premium Economy passenger in the second J class galley who said he booked his elderly parent's seat that way in order to be able to check on them during the flight. What this means for other passengers is a constant flow of people coming from Premium Economy to check on ""mummy"" up in business class. It makes the cabin feel busy and noisy and one has to endure great long chats between adult child and hard-of-hearing mummy about how to maneuver mommy's seat, etc. I have about eight such passengers around me and feel like I'm in a flying nursing home.",late depart montreal accord captain announc meal still need load board chief purser later told bunch thing get today mean us passeng dinner servic bit shambol cabin crew busi class seem uncoordin disjoint main cours arriv bare warm ask heat return quit time later dri certainli meal expect premium cabin major carrier learn particular rout back busi cabin prefer custom adult children sit next cabin back premium economi adult child frequent come busi cabin check elderli parent met premium economi passeng second j class galley said book elderli parent seat way order abl check flight mean passeng constant flow peopl come premium economi check mummi busi class make cabin feel busi noisi one endur great long chat adult child hard hear mummi maneuv mommi seat etc eight passeng around feel like fli nurs home

"Not Verified|  This is literally the worst airline ever. I have been stuck in Canada for 2 nights, soon to be a third, due to their incompetence and disregard of passengers. Our connecting flight (which would have been 60 minutes) was abruptly canceled due to no staffing. We encountered quite possibly the rudest woman on earth at the ""customer service"" area. Not only was she nasty and callous, booking us for a flight in 3 days, she didn't offer any information about what to do next, she literally turned her back. We had to ask a security guard where to go next to try to remedy our situation. 5 hours later, we were sent to a hotel nowhere near the airport with only one night of hotel paid. Fast forward to today, we are still sitting in the airport. Our flight was due to leave 4.5 hours ago. Initially, it was delayed for a late crew, then maintenance, then weather. We finally boarded, only to sit on the runway for 90 minutes before we were deplaned.

"Not Verified| This trip was not enjoyable. As a start, there was 2+ hour delay. The crew at Vancouver Airport spoke very little English, and had zero interest in guiding about compensation. Some said finally after looking at brochures: you can get a meal voucher. That queue (100 m line pointed out) gave up on that one. The flight from YVR to YYZ was OK in my seat almost at the back. But Air Canada really should revise their customer message system. First the safety video is like 8 minutes. Then you are forced to view COMMERCIALS for another 5 minutes. Not even Ryanair would do that. And on top, EVERY video were starting with more commercials, that thankfully could be skipped. Once the flight got off, Air Canada interrupted the screen, movies etc, with announcements literally every 10 minutes. First in English, then in French. After the 10th announcement to please take seats and fasten belts, something they did at every small bump, people were like: Yeah, we got it. A simple icon lighting up has worked for years elsewhere. I wish the screen could be set to non-interrupt. Second leg was also delayed 2+ hours. Again NO compensation. Nobody to ask about anything. This flight had much worse seats. Plastic shells like Ryanair, and very narrow. Old lagging movie screens, and again same commercials, same interruptions. Of course in French, on a plane headed to Scandinavia. There probably was 0 French speakers on board. Food served was a tasteless chicken boiled to oblivion. Just before landing in CPH, a ""continental breakfast"" was served. A VERY dry croissant, and a minimum yoghurt. That's it? Air Canada, you completely fail this breakfast. Among the many announcements, there was not really any about the flight route, or connections on arrival.

"✅Trip Verified|  We got a vacation of a lifetime and upgraded to business class on the way out of Toronto. Of course, Air Canada didn't miss an opportunity to ruin this experience. We boarded our first plane, got comfortable, and then noticed that it's getting increasingly hot and we're not really going anywhere. Then the plane went dead, and rebooted itself. At this point the captain announced that we're having trouble with the air conditioning, and the plane would be rebooted again. After an hour or so on the plane, we were told we need to get off, but not go too far away, since they need to reset the AC and can't do it with us on the plane, and it'll take about 30 minutes. Then we got delayed by another 30 minutes. Then by 30 minutes more. All this time we had to hang around the loud, noisy, crowded gate to ensure we don't miss boarding. Turns out, we didn't need to worry, because the flight eventually got delayed by three more hours for a total of 6.5 hour delay. We did fly out on a second plane, but well past midnight.

"✅Trip Verified|  The flight was delayed as many families with children were late and the plane waited. I was on time and sat on the tarmac for an hour. Our flight was at 940am we didnt take of until 1045am. After take-off, the entertainment was abysmal as you had to pay extra to login on your phone to watch anything and it was always loosing connection and screwing up. Then a stewardess screamed at me, for me to turn the volume down. The volume was not loud at all. What happened to customer service? She screamed across 2 people as I was at the window. If I acted the way she did at my job, I would have been fired in a heartbeat. Food on the menu was not available by the time the flight attendants got to my row to ask for orders. They had a cookie and a Pepsi, this was what was left. The flight back on September 1st was even worse. I was stuck next to the flight attendant seat so I had this wall of intrusive plastic pushing me out of my seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes.

"✅Trip Verified|  The flight going to LA was terrible to begin with. June 1st flight to LA was delayed by 2 hours due to lack of workers in their baggage section in Toronto. On June 4th, coming back here is even worse. The AC ground crews in LA were cranky and rude. The crew incorrectly announced that our flight was cancelled. My brother then asked why it was cancelled. The crew snapped back to say no questions asked, flight was cancelled. Surprised, we then reconfirmed with the other lady crew if our flight was indeed cancelled. The lady told us it wasn’t our flight that was cancelled but the flight next to ours which was AC792. The crew didn’t apologize for the error, instead they took our carry on luggage against our own will saying they didn’t have enough space. I told the guy if I could get something inside my carry on and he refused! My husband told him I needed to take this one important item inside and he snapped back along with the lady crew and said: “If you don’t comply, you can take the other flight which was already cancelled!” Their rudeness continued on as they speak with other passengers in line. These employees need to be reminded of common courtesy and proper work ethics when speaking to people who give them business and existence! No professionalism at all. Bad customer service. The flight attendants were very classy, considerate and courteous. Mid flight the air conditioning broke down, I almost passed out due to warm air blowing on my face, then they had to close the washroom for the entire duration of the flight!

"✅Trip Verified| I traveled from Dallas to Regina. On way back from Regina had to take a connecting flight in Montreal where had to pass through customs. There was so much confusion and no one from Air Canada would guide passengers properly. They were all in a cranky mood and didn’t have patience to listen and guide property. Flight was delayed for 40 minutes as we had to wait for other flights that were delayed. People were upset and complaining that staff was not at all helpful, I had planned to buy food on board but crew just gave me beverage and didn’t ask about food. I thought will ask me later but then I saw crew sitting and eating their dinner. I asked one of crew members aren’t you selling food to which he replied we asked but you didn’t want anything. I told him that is a false statement you never asked me about food. I told him that I would like to purchase food and he said we have nothing. I got upset at his behavior so a senior member came and showed me a menu. There were only two choices so I selected one. They didn’t have much food so avoided asking passengers. When I landed in Dallas I found out that I was the only person on two flights from Montreal whose luggage has not arrived. It was 12.15 am. Lady at the airport said it will come on 10 am flight but was not on that flight. Then I was told will come on 7 pm flight. I am still waiting.

"✅Trip Verified|  We were flying to Vancouver from Copenhagen via Toronto on June 1st. First they cancelled our flight then rebooked us. The flight they rebooked was then delayed by 5.5 hours in Toronto. There were hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport and only one customer service desk to service all the customers. On the way back from Vancouver to Cleveland via Toronto, the flight to Toronto was initially delayed by 2.5 hours then cancelled because of pilot shortage. They rebooked us through United and said our bags will be transferred to United but when we arrived at the gate to board the united flight we were denied boarding because Air Canada never transferred the bags over. It took them over an hour to find the bags. They rebooked the flight the second time eventually after I spent an hour and a half talking with the reservation agent and the check in agent. Both of whom kept saying that I would have to talk to the other. The fact that Air Canada is a star alliance member is mind boggling given that their customer service and flight operations are so poorly run.

✅Trip Verified|  We arrived from Tokyo to Miami after having a layover in Canada. We asked at least 9 employees between Tokyo and Canada if we should pick up our luggage and check it back in or if there was anything we had to do in order to not have the luggage forgotten at the layover in Canada. Three of them had no idea what the proper process was and of them told us we did not have to do anything and it would ship directly to Miami. We arrived in Miami and to our surprise our luggage was not there. We then received a text message saying the following “Bag is delayed Tag # (Booking #) Expected to arrive in Miami MIA May 27 22:29 Arrange delivery here: flyac.ca” we arranged the delivery and again to our surprise the luggage is not getting to Miami until tonight and will not be delivered till 3 days later. We called to see if they would provide us with some funds to be able to purchase the necessary items needed for the time being and we’re told we would have to purchase them on our own and maybe after we could put a claim in and see if they approve it or not. We asked for a time line of how long the approval usually take and we’re refused an answer. We asked to speak to a supervisor and we’re told they do not have any supervisors that could help us and refused to put us trough to a supervisor after which they told us to hang up.

"✅Trip Verified|  My party of 5 booked with Air Canada to fly from Las Vegas to Vancouver and Vancouver to Sydney in October 2022. I was travelling with my elderly parents and paid more to get the premium seats with extra leg room for all persons in our party. I also chose the flights to ensure our transit and waiting times were not too long, as our party and especially my elderly parents would not cope well long transit times. In November 2022, I received notification due to change in flight schedules, our new flight and transit time in Vancouver would now be 12 hours. This would not work for us, and based on the Air Canada email I would log onto the Air Canada notification I would log onto the Air Canada website and make changes to the new flights or request a refund if the new schedule did I work. If seemed there were no other flights or information available for me to reschedule and so I wanted to cancel our flights to book with another airline, to get a refund the website said to contact Air Canada. This is when I found out there is NO WAY to communicate with Air Canada outside of Canada and the US. I searched all over the internet and only found numbers for people within Canada and US. At my wits end, I posted a message on the Air Canada Facebook. I got a response, and I explained the situation with my parents and that a 12 hours transit time was not workable for my situation, and if there were any other flights available with shorter transit times. I didn't get a response for 4 weeks, and had to continually send messages via Facebook. I informed them of the urgency and the need for a response, I requested that if flights with shorter time I wanted a refund, so I could purchase tickets with another airline. I got a response. I explained that the final leg of my flight from Vancouver to Sydney we had bought specific seats in row 18 with extra leg room, and wanted to confirm there seats were still ours. I was assured that seeing that flight and plane had not changed, so our booking and seats remained the same. I breathed a sigh of relief. All this took 2 months! Then at the end of Feb 2023, about 9 weeks before I was due to leave for my holiday, I received another notification that my flights had once again been rescheduled to the 12 hours transit schedule! I was furious and distressed and once again, had to message Air Canada to explain the situation again, and why a 12 hour transit time did not work and posed a risk to my parents health. I also requested a confirmation that our purchased seats had not changed. I got a response on Facebook and our flights were once again moved to the flights that I had been rescheduled to. They could not explain by my flights had been moved to the 12 hours transit time! Then in May 2023 24 hours before our flight was due to leave from Las Vegas > Vancouver > to Sydney I got the standard check-in email for our flights. I logged in and to my surprise, the seats in row 18 we have purchase 8 months ago were no longer our seats. We had no seats assigned let alone seats with extra leg room. On the app I got a message that if I wanted extra leg room, I would need to pay $164 per seat. The seats in row 18 were no longer available. I spent 30 minutes on hold and another 30 minutes with the person on the phone, who confimed I had purchased there seats 8 months ago, but coudln't explain these seats were no longer available.",parti book air canada fli la vega vancouv vancouv sydney octob travel elderli parent paid get premium seat extra leg room person parti also chose flight ensur transit wait time long parti especi elderli parent would cope well long transit time novemb receiv notif due chang flight schedul new flight transit time vancouv would hour would work us base air canada email would log onto air canada notif would log onto air canada websit make chang new flight request refund new schedul work seem flight inform avail reschedul want cancel flight book anoth airlin get refund websit said contact air canada found way commun air canada outsid canada us search internet found number peopl within canada us wit end post messag air canada facebook got respons explain situat parent hour transit time workabl situat flight avail shorter transit time get respons week continu send messag via facebook inform urgenc need respons request flight shorter time want refund could purchas ticket anoth airlin got respons explain final leg flight vancouv sydney bought specif seat row extra leg room want confirm seat still assur see flight plane chang book seat remain breath sigh relief took month end feb week due leav holiday receiv anoth notif flight reschedul hour transit schedul furiou distress messag air canada explain situat hour transit time work pose risk parent health also request confirm purchas seat chang got respons facebook flight move flight reschedul could explain flight move hour transit time may hour flight due leav la vega vancouv sydney got standard check email flight log surpris seat row purchas month ago longer seat seat assign let alon seat extra leg room app got messag want extra leg room would need pay per seat seat row longer avail spent minut hold anoth minut person phone confim purchas seat month ago coudln explain seat longer avail

I chose a flight with Air Canada because the connections were good - departing London at 9:20 am to Montreal, then Montreal direct to Sydney, arriving late afternoon. Very civilised. However, the flight was more than an hour late departing from London and as a result I missed my connection in Montreal. They rebooked me from Montreal to Toronto, then on to Sydney, arriving at midnight. Effectively adding eight hours to my trip. I requested a pass for the lounge to compensate for the extra time I had to spend in the airport at Montreal. I am an AC frequent flyer, but had already spent a lot of my points. I would have had enough points for lounge access if they had added on the flight from London, but they flatly refused to grant me access in spite of the trouble they had caused me.

This was a fully booked flight and because we did not check in soon enough, my wife and were stuck sitting in seats 30 B and C. This row of seats had no window and where there should have been two seats the airline shoved in three, and the door to a toilet was directly beside us in an already narrowed corridor? To somehow squeeze in beside our fellow passenger seated in 30 A seat with no window we were crammed into the equivalent of a 3/4 seat with limited ability to even rest our arms during the flight. It all added up to the most unpleasant transatlantic flight I have ever been on. The bottom line? Air Canada on row 30 on this plane you need to remove a seat!

"✅Trip Verified|  My family and I flew with Air Canada just two days ago from Sydney to Boston, with two layovers in Vancouver and Montreal.  Our flights were delayed, particularly the Montreal to Boston which was delayed by around 2 hours (making the wait 6 hours) and the food was not exactly appetising either - which isn't even the important part. The main thing I really wanted to complain about was how badly they handled our luggage. After our 24 hours of travelling, after arriving in Boston, the last thing I wanted was for us to find out, how our luggage had been stuck in Montreal. And we weren't the only ones - half the passengers on this same flight were also in the same situation. We ended up having to leave the airport with nothing other than our carry-ons which did not hold much and simply had to wait for our luggage to be delivered, hopefully early morning the next day, as they told us. However, even that would not be the case. Our luggage was told to arrive that following morning, yet it did not. We had absolutely nothing and thus our initial personal schedule was pushed back and we could not do the plans we had made. They had delayed our luggage delivery saying that it would get to our door anytime before 7PM. And so we just waited. Until they told us that it would come at 8PM. We waited once again. Later we called them to find out that they could not even contact the delivery people who were supposed to be delivering it, which we found extremely unprofessional. And just as a further note, our suitcases were apparently at Boston since that morning, yet they failed to do the simple job of delivering it at the expected time they had informed us with. Not only that, they must have left our suitcases in the pouring rain as even when we did receive our hard case suitcases, half our clothes and items were very wet and soggy which added onto how annoying this situation already was. They did not compensate, no nothing.

"✅Trip Verified| Just another awful experience with Air Canada. Flying from Toronto Pearson to Seattle to connect to another flight there. The flight was delayed, and kept on being delayed for close to 4hrs, by which time it was no longer necessary to travel (as I would have missed my connection). The ground staff helped me to cancel my check in and confirmed that I would no longer be flying, and I must say they were extremely helpful, and offered whatever assistance they could. However, everything from then was a nightmare. As I checked two pieces of luggage, it was not possible to retrieve it until the next day. When I returned to the airport to try and locate the bag, I was informed it went missing but the staff assured me that it did not leave the airport. I filed a missing bag report, and then followed up repeated for over a month. Granted, Toronto Pearson had experienced a severe backlog of delayed/lost luggage due to a recent storm, but then this is not helped by the fact that every time I spoke to an AC representative, I was told a different story. Only a month of following up and hoping for the best did I receive both bags back--one of which was damaged beyond repair. I should add that AC were quite responsive in processing my claim for compensation, as I needed to purchase clothing and essentials as a result of the lost luggage. And they paid back every expense (though that did take a while to process). Also, AC did compensate me for the damaged bag as well. Other than this, just another awful experience of a dysfunctional airline (though some of the staff have been quite friendly and helpful).",anoth aw experi air canada fli toronto pearson seattl connect anoth flight flight delay kept delay close hr time longer necessari travel would miss connect ground staff help cancel check confirm would longer fli must say extrem help offer whatev assist could howev everyth nightmar check two piec luggag possibl retriev next day return airport tri locat bag inform went miss staff assur leav airport file miss bag report follow repeat month grant toronto pearson experienc sever backlog delay lost luggag due recent storm help fact everi time spoke ac repres told differ stori month follow hope best receiv bag back one damag beyond repair add ac quit respons process claim compens need purchas cloth essenti result lost luggag paid back everi expens though take process also ac compens damag bag well anoth aw experi dysfunct airlin though staff quit friendli help

"✅Trip Verified|  Worst flight experience. Travelled with two small children and two car seats. When flight was booked it stated one carryon and one personal item per passenger. We took 2 carry on bags and strapped the car seats to each for more convenient transport since we had two small children in tow. When we went to get boarding passes, they told us we had to check our carryons. I told them it was our mode of transport for the car seats and they said it was policy on small full flights that all carryons be checked unless flying business class. I said can we just check at the gate if there is truly no space. Again told no. I said it would have been nice to have been told this information sooner than the day of the flight o we could have arranged for a different mode of transport for the car seats or packages them properly to check them. The first gate wasn’t too far but to get to the connecting flight it was far. We had to carry these bulky awkward car seats with no good surfaces to hold the entire trip. When we boarded the first flight and the flight attendants were closing the overhead storage compartments, they closed several empty compartments, yet we had to check our bags. Upon arrival to our destination we found that they had now lost our carry on luggage that they forced us to check in the first place. Reported that it was not there and they told us it was in our layover city and they would get it in next possible flight and deliver that evening or next day. Second day of no luggage and we are going to have to buy more diapers and toothbrushes and hairbrush and at least a change of clothes for our children. They cannot even tell us where the luggage is when we call. They are marked and scanned throughout the process so how is that not registering in the system when they enter in the id number for the tagged bags. This is not the first time we have lost luggage on a flight, but it is the first time we have not been able to get information regarding the process of retrieval. There is no good contact number to just call and file a complaint. It was an email process. This airline is in no way accommodating to family travel aside from somewhat early boarding. They give conflicting information when you do talk to a company representative, and offer no real answer as to how they are working to resolve your issue. They offer zero compensation for the major inconvenience.",worst flight experi travel two small children two car seat flight book state one carryon one person item per passeng took carri bag strap car seat conveni transport sinc two small children tow went get board pass told us check carryon told mode transport car seat said polici small full flight carryon check unless fli busi class said check gate truli space told said would nice told inform sooner day flight could arrang differ mode transport car seat packag properli check first gate far get connect flight far carri bulki awkward car seat good surfac hold entir trip board first flight flight attend close overhead storag compart close sever empti compart yet check bag upon arriv destin found lost carri luggag forc us check first place report told us layov citi would get next possibl flight deliv even next day second day luggag go buy diaper toothbrush hairbrush least chang cloth children cannot even tell us luggag call mark scan throughout process regist system enter id number tag bag first time lost luggag flight first time abl get inform regard process retriev good contact number call file complaint email process airlin way accommod famili travel asid somewhat earli board give conflict inform talk compani repres offer real answer work resolv issu offer zero compens major inconveni
"✅Trip Verified| I have had a very bad experience with Air Canada. I was flying round trip from London to Toronto late last year and they completely destroyed my luggage. After a rude encounter with the Air Canada lady at Toronto airport I had to go through months of unanswered emails and calls to try and sort out the situation. Eventually they agreed to refund me for my damaged baggage 3 months later. However, they would only send me a compensation in a Canadian bank account, which of course I don't have as I am a tourist. I explained this over multiple emails and calls, but nothing happened. I was told repeatedly to just be patient and they would contact me when they could find the time! That never happened. The voucher for the compensation expired and they never answered my demands for an alternative payment type. It has now been over 6 months and I have lost all faith. I believe they never intended to compensate me or indeed any other foreigner. I am convinced that if I was a Canadian they would have compensated me ages ago.",bad experi air canada fli round trip london toronto late last year complet destroy luggag rude encount air canada ladi toronto airport go month unansw email call tri sort situat eventu agre refund damag baggag month later howev would send compens canadian bank account cours tourist explain multipl email call noth happen told repeatedli patient would contact could find time never happen voucher compens expir never answer demand altern payment type month lost faith believ never intend compens inde foreign convinc canadian would compens age ago
"✅Trip Verified|  It has been an interesting experience with Air Canada today, I had flew frequently by carrying on the same carry luggage in February 2023. I had no problem flew with porter three days ago from Ottawa to Toronto, unfortunately, I was stopped by a crew who targeted me and force me to pay the check in luggage cost rudely, and even spoke to his manager beforehand when I requested to speak to. I saw many others carrying bigger luggage than mine, they even didn’t have any problems to get into the gate! My carry on luggage is the right size and needs to push in the measurement but was considered as non compliance.

"Not Verified| We flew from Toronto, Canada (YYZ) to Providenciales, Turks and Caicos (BPV) for vacation. Everything was amazing the crew was easily 5 stars, we met one of the flight attendants at the gate and saw our kids looking at all the planes, she offered them to sit in the cockpit once we made it to our destination. The kids enjoyed the flight. The flight came with complimentary drinks, the food did cost extra we didn't purchase but other passengers were saying it was well worth it. The IFE had lots of options and the WIFI was very fast. The pilots made a very soft landing we deboarded in 5 minutes, we did deboard last because the pilots let the kids stay in the cockpit for a bit, they learned so much!

"Not Verified|  Flight was supposed to be on Feb 24 to Manila via Vancouver. The flight was cancelled on Feb 24 (I was already checked in online), due to ""technical issues"" we flew on Feb 25 but the flight was delayed by two hours, hence, we missed our connecting flight. They re-booked us on a different airline but in economy (our seats were supposed to be Premium Economy). Tried to complain at the airport bur nobody knows anything at the desk so they gave me a pamphlet on how to claim. Then there's the retrieval of our luggage (tagged ""Priority Handling""). Nobody at Vancouver airport knows where our luggage's are to be retrieved so we lined up for two hours at luggage claim (not knowing whether we were in the right line). We asked somebody wearing uniform and holding a walkie talkie (two of them actually) - they said they will find out and walked away quickly - never came back. After two hours online we were given directions to re-book and go back to the same counter where there were more than 80 people lined up. We rebooked our flight successfully - no help from Air Canada. Returned to the line and after another 45 minutes, were able to retrieve our luggage. This was the most horrible experience in my 30 years of flying. Upon return I followed the instructions on re-claiming. After a week, Air Canada came back with claim denied because it is not within their control - ""Technical Issues"". Everything is a technical issue with this airline.

"Not Verified|  Awful. We had two legs - first in a Dash-8 from SEA to YVR, then a 777-300 to LHR. Our first flight was delayed by an hour for a number of reasons. When we landed the connecting flight was already in the boarding process and we had to high tail it straight through the airport. Good job we were travelling light with carryon only - at Heathrow we passed a crowd of unfortunate travellers who had checked bags on the first leg and none of them had made it on the second flight. This included a couple whose carryon had been checked because there wasn't enough room overhead. The main leg of the journey was 9.5 hours. The legroom in economy was abysmal - I'm 5'11 and I had to put my knees in the little hard nooks either side of the seat under the next row's armrests. I was fortunate that passengers sitting each side of me were quite petite and were able to twist sideways a little for us all to fit. The entertainment system was good, although don't expect headphones to be provided by Air Canada. You can request earbuds that hurt after an hour or so of use, so make sure you bring your own nice headphones. The food was awful. I had ordered an Asian Vegetarian special meal - usually a safe bet for a bit of flavour on an airplane. It came warm on the outside and still frozen in the center. No bread or butter - it consisted of a small portion of plain cous cous, a some rice with a single cauliflower floret, and a tiny pot of tinned fruit salad. The regular meal seemed to be equally unappetising - chicken in tomato sauce. I noticed that my neighbours on the flight both left most of theirs. But at least they got a roll and a slice of cheese with their meal. I also had no drink with my meal, as they served all the special meals first before prepping the others, and they brink the drinks cart round after the regular meal cart.  The stewardess who seemed to be most in charge of things had an awful attitude with both passengers and her colleagues. Didn't see a single smile out of them the whole flight. You get a comically small bottle of water on the plane, but getting hold of anyone for another is an absolute mission. I managed to catch a stewardess as they were walking up the aisle to ask for some water, they just said that a bar service would be coming through shortly. It did, albeit an hour later, and that was the only time cold drinks were served on the flight. I also saw some poor victim get the same treatment from the other side of the aircraft - came to the galley to ask for a soda, told to return to his seat and they'd be coming through soon, which they didn't. The 2nd meal wasn't a meal, it was a small dry muffin. (That came with a salt and pepper sachet for some reason). I would avoid Air Canada like the plague. You expect better from a flag carrier, but I'd rather spend 9.5 hours on a budget short haul flight than fly AC again.

"✅Trip Verified|  I travelled round trip from Seattle to Punta Cana via Toronto. On the way there, there were several issues. First off, seats were highly uncomfortable. Furthermore, the cushions were poorly secured, and slid around underneath you. The leg room was nonexistent. I literally could not fit my knees in front of me on the plane.  There were no power outlets or Wi-Fi on the plane. The return flight was what really set this experience apart though. Terrible seats, no leg room, no amenities. However, the airline made a mistake scheduling the flight, causing it to be 3 hours delayed. Our layover was 3 hours and 40 minutes, which meant that we would have 20 minutes to get to our gate. We contacted the airline about this, and they assured us that we would easily be able to make our connection (quote “that is plenty of time to get there”), and that they would hold the plane back a few minutes to wait for us if necessary. Upon arriving after an uncomfortable and long flight, we could not make it to the other gate in time, and they refused to hold it back for us. The airline scheduled us flights to Seattle the next day, with a layover. We were supposed to get to Seattle Sunday afternoon, but our new flight plan had us arriving late Monday evening. We then waited over 2 hours in line at a very busy and crowded Air Canada service desk. the service was incredibly slow, but eventually they told us that there were much better flights we could have got that would have gotten us home much earlier, but they sold out in the time we stood in the line.

"✅Trip Verified| Fort Lauderdale to Montreal on Air Canada. Check in was smooth and handled by a friendly and courteous agent at the Priority counter. Unfortunately things went downhill from there on. Boarding was absolute mayhem with gate agents giving conflicting instructions. To make matters worse, instead of using the zone-based queues at the designated gate, they decided to use the lanes of the neighbouring gate causing a mass migration, not to mention confusion, for some 200 passengers. The gate agents were not only unorganized they were actually surly with the passengers. In the end it became a free-for-all boarding experience. When I got on board, I mentioned the chaos at the gate to one of the agents who was not even remotely interested in hearing about it and pretty much brushed it off. We were almost 40 minutes late leaving FLL which stretched the flight duration from 3 hours to 4 gate to gate. During this time the FA’s came around with water and beverage service only once and acted as if they were doing the passengers a favour. In all my travels around the globe I have never encountered a flight crew so aloof and uninterested in doing their jobs. The hard product was decent and the IFE had a good selection of movies, music and games. The washrooms looked like they had not been tended to in weeks and they surely were not going to receive any attention from the crew operating the flight.

"✅Trip Verified|  The seats that are comically narrow for an average-sized person. I made the mistake of purchasing two round-trip tickets from Orlando to Montréal, hoping for a comfortable flight next to my wife in a two-seat row. Unfortunately, the seats proved to be too small by 2 to 4 inches for most people, and for me, almost six inches. While I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 280 lbs, I am not excessively large. As soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off, I had to stand for the entire flight until it was back on, as there was no comfort in those seats for either me or my wife. The flight attendants were indifferent to our plight. In particular, one of them kept knocking into my wife whenever she passed by. Although it was probably not intentional, my wife eventually had to change seats to avoid her. Moreover, the crew at the Orlando airport was making overlapping announcements, making it impossible to comprehend their boarding process and group numbers.",seat comic narrow averag size person made mistak purchas two round trip ticket orlando montr al hope comfort flight next wife two seat row unfortun seat prove small inch peopl almost six inch feet inch tall weigh lb excess larg soon seatbelt sign turn stand entir flight back comfort seat either wife flight attend indiffer plight particular one kept knock wife whenev pass although probabl intent wife eventu chang seat avoid moreov crew orlando airport make overlap announc make imposs comprehend board process group number

Now for comparison, pretty much the exact same thing happened coming home excpt it was Lufthansa.

"✅Trip Verified|  On the day of our flight, Air Canada moved us out of our preferred seating that we had purchased, without our permission. We were informed at the departure gates that the refund would be automatic since the change was made by Air Canada, but we have yet to receive any refund. Instead I had to apply for a refund, which will take up to 45 days. At the gates when I asked to change back to my preferred seats, I was told that I had made the change myself, the system had moved my daughter to a regular seat because she did not have a K-eta. Both reasons were preposterous. First, my daughter and I were travelling together. She is a minor and there is no reason why I would separate her from me so that she would sit in a regular seat among strangers. Second, when I said that I did not make any changes to the seating and that I had paid for the preferred seats, the staff at the counter then said that it was the ""system"" that did it. The story went as follows. We did not get a K-eta three hours before the flight, and therefore the change was made automatically. I also did not have a K-eta, but I was not moved automatically. By moving my daughter to a regular seat did not make her more able to travel to Korea without a K-eta. Regular or preferred seating, one needed the K-eta. I also learned that in the meantime they had sold the preferred seat to another woman. I asked that my daughter's seat be reinstated because we were the original buyers of the seat. I was told that since I could get a refund for my daughter's seat but not the other lady (she had used up her refunds), they would not reinstate my seat. As a result of Air Canada’s actions, both my daughter and I were inconvenienced with the regular seats while the other lady enjoyed the preferred seat at our expense. In other words, Air Canada has placed the other woman’s interest over ours. Is this their corporate policy? They then took 20 minutes to sort out the seating. I was suggested the last row of the plane, just in front of 4 toilets and the food preparation area. There was no other choice given to us unless we were prepared to be separated. I did not want to create a scene at the departure gate as we were already in the last hour before the flight. I reluctantly accept it because not to do so would cause further inconvenience with our travel plans. The seats turned out to be terrible and experience of the flight was excruciating for both of us. During the 12 hours flight, there was constant vacuum flushing of toilets, strong food smells emanating from the preparation area, a male crew member who talked non-stop in a loud voice, and a hysterical crying baby whose parents decided that the back of plane was a better area for her to calm down. Both of us did not get any sleep during the 12-hour flight. All in all, it was a flight from hell. The reason why we chose to pay for the preferred seats was to avoid the problems of being assigned to bad seats. However, Air Canada did not honor its contract with us. We had entered into a contract to fly on the preferred seats and Air Canada had unilaterally cancelled our contract.",day flight air canada move us prefer seat purchas without permiss inform departur gate refund would automat sinc chang made air canada yet receiv refund instead appli refund take day gate ask chang back prefer seat told made chang system move daughter regular seat k eta reason preposter first daughter travel togeth minor reason would separ would sit regular seat among stranger second said make chang seat paid prefer seat staff counter said system stori went follow get k eta three hour flight therefor chang made automat also k eta move automat move daughter regular seat make abl travel korea without k eta regular prefer seat one need k eta also learn meantim sold prefer seat anoth woman ask daughter seat reinstat origin buyer seat told sinc could get refund daughter seat ladi use refund would reinstat seat result air canada action daughter inconvenienc regular seat ladi enjoy prefer seat expens word air canada place woman interest corpor polici took minut sort seat suggest last row plane front toilet food prepar area choic given us unless prepar separ want creat scene departur gate alreadi last hour flight reluctantli accept would caus inconveni travel plan seat turn terribl experi flight excruci us hour flight constant vacuum flush toilet strong food smell eman prepar area male crew member talk non stop loud voic hyster cri babi whose parent decid back plane better area calm us get sleep hour flight flight hell reason chose pay prefer seat avoid problem assign bad seat howev air canada honor contract us enter contract fli prefer seat air canada unilater cancel contract
"✅Trip Verified|  My flight was delayed by more than 12 hours and they did not uphold the Canadian Air Protection rights I was deserving of. They were suppose to provide us with accommodation since it was an overnight flight and the delay was more than 4 hours, but they told us “we don’t offer that service” and we had to spend the night on the airport floor.

This was the first time that 2 Star Alliance tickets could not be joined, on may way to Canada I was even rerouted via Skyteam and it was possible. What is the purpose of Star Alliance then.

"Not Verified|  I have an upcoming flight. I made a mistake in entering my wife’s maiden name instead of her married, legal name. Air Canada was extremely clear, helpful, and responsive in resolving this issue. This started with their actually promptly answering the phone. I’ve been on hold with Aer Lingus for over 100 minutes, but was on hold with Air Canada for 30 seconds. This makes a difference. And the person who answered was very easy to understand and articulate - a native English speaker. I was anxious about the problem and asked a number of questions, on the phone and by email. In every case they responded quickly and clearly, making the resolution happen. I just needed a marriage certificate. They assured me they could resolve it promptly and when I did send the certificate it was resolved in a few hours. I’ve had very different experiences, say with Spirit Airlines. Not sure if it is resolved with them or not.",upcom flight made mistak enter wife maiden name instead marri legal name air canada extrem clear help respons resolv issu start actual promptli answer phone hold aer lingu minut hold air canada second make differ person answer easi understand articul nativ english speaker anxiou problem ask number question phone email everi case respond quickli clearli make resolut happen need marriag certif assur could resolv promptli send certif resolv hour differ experi say spirit airlin sure resolv

Our first flight was delayed well over an hour and the second one was 1.5 hours (almost all Air Canada flights delayed). There were no weather issues or other explanations offered to anyone. Also, while attempting to check-in online we realized they had not seated us together even though we had booked these flights 2 months prior. The only way to get seated together online or at the airport was by paying a seat upgrade fee, per person, per flight. Air Canada counter person also forced me to check a bag even though my luggage met the criteria for carry on. On both flights we noticed many others around us also separated from each other so among ourselves we moved around til everyone was seated together.  We were also bumped from our second flight since an earlier flight had been cancelled, causing us to take a later flight and arrive home 1.5 hours later (at 1:30 am).

Food (chicken or veggie pasta) was passable and no worse than American/United (though portion size was very small). Only snack available were pretzels. Entertainment system had a good UI but the selection (especially for shows) was lacklustre. Seats in a 3x3x3 configuration and pretty standard for the 787 (seats are exactly the same as the ones on American). Given they have a near monopoly on the Canadian market, I will undoubtedly fly with them again.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada is the only airline flying non-stop from North America to Bangkok and this route appears to be a winner for them. The flight left on time late in the day and arrived in the early morning. Standard pod-style seating in the business class which allows one to sleep comfortably on this long (almost 16 hour) flight. Meals were very good, an area in which AC has made significant strides. I opted not to have a large meal immediately after take-off, but rather after sleeping, which was accommodated. This airline has an excellent selection of films in a number of different languages and from a variety of countries. Cabin crew was attentive.

"✅Trip Verified| Consistently no coffee on flights. This is not the first time it happening, I would say In my last 10 trips I have only been given coffee once. The more frustrating part is you are told “coffee maker is broken” or “we are brewing a fresh pot and will get back to you” never to receive or be offered an alternative. It’s frustrating, if you are not going to provide it just say so! Secondly, I was charged for a seat that I did not order, but couldn’t receive my boarding pass without paying for it, told to apply for the $ return online and given a website. Did so, received an acknowledgement that the request received and then that was it. probably costs about .30 cents to provide your customer a coffee, and to charge for a seat is ridiculous in the first place, but who knows maybe my $40 will break your bank Air Canada.",consist coffe flight first time happen would say last trip given coffe frustrat part told coffe maker broken brew fresh pot get back never receiv offer altern frustrat go provid say secondli charg seat order receiv board pass without pay told appli return onlin given websit receiv acknowledg request receiv probabl cost cent provid custom coffe charg seat ridicul first place know mayb break bank air canada

I write this with great deal of pain that my flying experience with Air Canada in the recent past has been nothing but disappointing. My most recent trip to England (Jan 18th to 30th) for a family tragedy was the last straw. I will try to avoid flying Air Canada unless there is no other choice! My experience from start to end was very disappointing. The service on the plane was bare minimal. The food was horrible. I went to the back of the plane to use the washroom and spoke to the staff, I mentioned how bad the food was, I said people feed their pets better food than what we had, the buns were like plastic (I noticed most of the buns went to the garbage because people didn't/couldn't eat them, staff was very sympathetic, one of them nodded and said ""you should complain because they (AC management) don't listen to us"". On my return flight I had a layover in Toronto. They didn't offer anything let alone the garbage food they served on previous flights.

"✅Trip Verified| Air Canada left us with a horrendous ending to an otherwise amazing vacation. Flight out of Cancun at 2pm was cancelled last minute due to ""maintenance issues"". Got rebooked on a ""9pm"" flight that didn't end up departing until 10:45pm after waiting over an hour on the tarmac. The AC rep at Cancun also booked us on the late 9:45pm flight out of Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie stating ""there was no earlier flight"". We later found out that was a lie when 2 other friends booked the 2:10pm flight from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie, after the lady told us there were no other flights. We then arrive in Toronto at 2am thinking there would be AC reps waiting for us to get hotel vouchers and meal vouchers, no one at any AC rep desks until 4am when we finally got hotel and meal vouchers. You only get 20 dollar meal vouchers for the entirety of the next day, when our flight wasn't until 9:45pm. Not to mention, you can only use them at the airport, where a coffee will run you roughly 10 dollars. They also had no idea where we had to go to catch the shuttle to our hotel. Fast forward to the next day, we spend hundreds of dollars on breakfast lunch and dinner, all uncompensated before finally arriving to the airport around 8pm for our 9:45pm flight. We walk into the airport just in time to receive an email from AC stating our flight has been cancelled for a 3rd time now due to ""crew shortages"" this time. Again, we get our hotel and meal vouchers from thr AC rep. They again tell us we will not be compensated for meals outside of the airport before giving us another measly 20 dollars in terrible overpriced airport food. We are booked on a 11:15am flight tomorrow now, but I'm sceptical it gets out due to AC incompetence. Update: flight was in fact delayed until 2:30pm.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada in flight crew could have shown a bit of human decency but did not. We flew Victoria-Vancouver-Toronto-Miami. Victoria to Vancouver was delayed as was Vancouver to Toronto. This put us into Toronto an hour and a half late, cutting our connecting flight time to Miami in half (significant when you have to go through security and customs). We spoke to two attendants on the flight about this, both said they would check and neither of them got back to us. We were also seated at the back of the plane (Air Canada changed our seats at the last minute) so it took forever to just get off the plane, leaving us to run and scramble through the airport. Our plane was loading as we were at security. If flight attendants were decent (no extra work required) they could have asked passengers who did not have connections to remain seated while those that had tight connections left the plane. This would have given us an extra 15 to 20 minutes, and would have relieved the stress. We did make the plane just before the gates closed but only because passengers at customs let us through.

Luggage situation was ludicrous after having checked our bags then having to spend hours to retrieve them with each cancelation. Hotel room was offered for us (2 adult males) with one queen bed.

"Not Verified|  The flight was delayed by 8 hours at Copenhagen. Air Canada provided updated ETA for departure three times. After third time of further delaying the flight, they announced food voucher, which was 100DKK (about $19CAD). This amount was insufficient to buy a food from a restaurant at the airport. There was no other compensation by Air Canada to the passengers suffering the extremely uncomfortable stay at the gate lounge. Due to this delay and unclear communication, I missed a critical meeting at work (estimated arrival was at 2:45PM ET, and my meeting was at 4PM for client year end review) and it has severely impacted my work. My wife and children also got impacted due to the extreme stress they had to go through, with minimal support from the Air Canada staff.

"✅Trip Verified|  My agent arranged flights with United Airlines and Air Canada for November 1, 2022. Twice my flight were cancelled. Neither time my flight was rescheduled, nor did the airlines notify me. On October 11, I called Air Canada to ask which gate I should arrive at. They told me that my flight had been cancelled on Sept. 12. Had I not contacted Air Canada about departure information, I would not have known. I spent hours with both airlines in the next two days. I was charged another $163 from Air Canada. I had to purchase new flights to Winnipeg. United told me I was due a refund of $26, and refused to give it to me. I informed both United and Air Canada that only I be allowed to make any further changes. They agreed. On October 31, my agent emailed me. She stated my entire, original $805 United/Air Canada charge was disputed by me. It was not. Once again, I had to call the airlines to confirm that her allegations were incorrect. Once again, much more wasted time and stress. Again, on October 31, less than 13 hours before my departure, my agent cancelled my flights with United and Air Canada. The airlines never informed me. They allowed my agent to cancel the flights that I made on October 11, despite their assurances that they would not be allowed to intervene. I spent hours again on the telephone hours before departure hoping that I would be allowed to depart. This new flight resulted in a three hour earlier departure, with an extra stop in Chicago. On November 1, I had to spend more of my vacation time trying to arrange another flight home. These airlines have caused me many, many hours of work, stress and extra expenses.

"✅Trip Verified| Air Canada is out of control! The organization has lost complete control of its Labour. The airline staff, the baggage handlers, the ticket agents. In this past week, December 23rd I flew from Vancouver to Toronto. Mother Nature had wreaked weather havoc across the country, Delays were expected and very much understandable. Many flights were cancelled by all airlines across the country 21 + 22 December. When I arrived at YVR for my flight on December 22 I was pleasantly surprised had our slightly delayed flight was indeed going to go today, in fact, Air Canada had organized four 777 aircraft including mine, to consolidate many of the affected customers. All four of these aircraft were departing for Toronto within an hour. So, after further delays, (2 more hours on the tarmac) we took off for Toronto. We arrived on the runway at 11:30pm, 4 hours after the original schedule l, but all too given the weather. Now the fun begins For the next 5 hours we sat on the plane, on the runway. With no updates or information we all just sat waiting. The airline staff would not serve us as much as a bottle of water. A gentleman behind me asked for some nuts several hours into the wait, told that everything was closed up. The airline staff, although being paid of course, were off duty as far as serving the customers! They did absolutely nothing for the customers, not even in Business class where we pay excessive rates, could we get a bottle of water during a 5 hour sit on the runway! A few days later Now December 27th, I am again on Air Canada flight in business class, Toronto to Doha to begin my journey back to Thailand. I have a 3 hour layover in Doha to connect to Bangkok. The airport (Terminal 3 Predominantly Air Canada) in complete complete chaos! Cannot even get to your boarding gates. Anyhow I do finally fight my way through the Air Canada customer crowds to get to my plane. As I sit in my seat, I receive a 35 minute delay notification from Air Canada. A while later I receive another 30 minute delay notice followed by a 15 and a 25. This goes on for 3 hours! Now I know my connection in Doha is As good as a gone. After take off I approach the In Charge to ask what happens now with me missing my connection l. I am advised to contact customer support after I arrive in Doha. Does anyone realize how long you wait to contact Air Canada customer support? Hours and hours if at all during their current spiral into Chaos! So bottom line, I am shot out of luck! Had to purchase another ticket! Sat in Doha airport sleeping on a bench for half day and Air Canada takes NO OWNERSHIP! And my final point to the readers, this 3 hour delay was due to shortage of baggage staff! This is the update the In Charge shared with me! They don’t have enough staff! Therefore they cannot get the planes loaded with your baggage on schedule! Have a look at the fields of baggage all over Pearson! It’s out of control!

"✅Trip Verified| Stay away from Air Canada if you can! This company has been dropping the quality of its service over the years. And every year it seems to get worse! The customer support line is horrible and you have to stay hours on the phone to get a hold of somebody. Good luck if you're late to a connecting flight or lost your luggage in a foreign country with Air Canada. You're pretty much on your own! Let's not forget about the incredibly complicated system to report a problem or request a refund after the fact. I feel that they do this on purpose to make it complicated so you give up on the refund. In addition, Air Canada is doing everything it can to take away your money. Until recently, you could take two 32 kg bags to countries with long routes, now it's a 23 kg bag and an absurd price to carry an additional bag. Air Canada does not care about you. I've had multiple experiences where my flight got delayed, they took 1.5 to 3 hours to pick up the phone when I needed it the most, left me stranded in foreign countries, cancelled the flight minutes before it should have left, not allowed me to board because of a simple name mistake that they took long to fix, deflecting ownership when tickets got purchased from other reputable websites, lack of seat or cabinet space due to overbooking, insane delays while leaving the Toronto airport, lack of communication between employees, and lack of of flight availability in connections. Do I need to go on? Do we all get the point? It's a shame for a company of this size and past reputation to get to such low standards. I've been traveling since I was a kid and I've always liked Air Canada. I always felt like I was ""at home"" when traveling with Air Canada. Nowadays, just remembering the name makes me angry because of the negative things the company did to me. Shame on Air Canada for firing thousands of their staff. This is one of the reasons why they are struggling to keep up with the customer needs. This goes to show how the leadership team at Air Canada are unprepared for the job and don't care about their customers or the company reputation. All they care about is their big fat bonuses at the end of the year. I really hate writing reviews but I felt an obligation to do so given the horrible service and after what the bad service they provided to me.

"✅Trip Verified| Air Canada is really struggling to be bearable. Upon landing at Pearson, it was announced overhead 3 times with apologies that my Tokyo Narita flight had moved to another carousel (quite far away). All passengers migrated to new carousel according to announcement. Ultimately no luggage arrived and had been delivered to the previous original carousel (without announcement). The bags had been removed by airport staff and set aside (with hundreds of others). The passengers became irate at the baggage men. Baggage men instructed passengers that this is not them but rather it’s always Air Canada who is incompetent. The staff on this flight had terrible attitude and looked like they hated their jobs and lives. Always avoid Air Canada whenever possible. If they were not a federal government backed (near) monopoly they would never survive in the real world.

"✅Trip Verified|  Does Air Canada have a plan for bad weather? Obviously their plan is no information for customers, low staffing, can't reach them on the phone, completely disorganized, just dump people in the airport with no assistance. When I checked in to my flight from Frankfurt, the automated system checked me into my current flight and the next flight that was scheduled to Indianapolis. Indianapolis was canceled, but I was not checked out of the flight. Since I was not off-boarded the replacement flight is there but I can't check in because I was not off-boarded from the original flight. Sadly the check-in crew at the airport can't figure this out and tell me I have to speak with reservations. Reservations are over the phone only and they are not answering the phone. 24 hour later, I finally spoke to reservations and they informed me only check-in at the airport can off-board me from the original flight, they can only get me a rescheduled flight after check-in off-boards me from the original flight. The only way to speak to check-in is to stand in the line with people checking their baggage, so you stand in line for an hour or more. Then check-in says I'm off-boarded, reservations says I'm not. And they don't talk to each other. So I have to wait in the at bag check line for the 3rd time to tell them I am not off boarded. Finally get it straightened out, start checking into flight and it gets canceled. This was the first of 4 different flights to get scheduled and canceled. My daughter finally drove 10 hours to Toronto, Canada to pick me up. I did not know and Air Canada did not tell me that I needed a reference # from baggage at the airport. I was escorted 3 times into the international carousel area looking for my bag, someone could have mentioned this? Since I do not have this # I cannot put in a request for lost baggage on-line. And of course the customer support line for lost baggage is not taking calls.

"✅Trip Verified|  I am very disappointed with my experience with Air Canada. I had a flight booked for 5am on Boxing Day from Halifax to Toronto with a planned layover before heading to Vancouver. My flight was cancelled the night before due to a stated lack of crew members. I was told via text that Air Canada would be contacting me with alternative routes shortly - this never happened. Not only did Air Canada not contact me with alternate routes, but they did not make it clear at all that the only way to get rescheduled was to call in to their call center - which at the time of the cancellation was so busy that they would not even put me on hold. I woke up at 6am the next morning and headed to the airport myself to speak to Air Canada staff, where I was told to call their customer service line as they could do nothing about bookings. After multiple call attempts I was put through to an agent - who told me that there had been a flight from Ottawa to Vancouver - but that I had been too late. Meaning Air Canada could have made the arrangements to save my flight and did not. Air Canada then gave me a flight that would land in Vancouver three days later than expected, stating it was the earliest flight. I just called again to try and rebook and was on hold for over an hour. When the music stopped - there was a blank pause and I was hung up on. I have never had a worse experience with a business in my life.

"✅Trip Verified|  We began our journey with Air Canada on the Wednesday before Christmas. My boyfriend and I had planned to fly into Montreal as it is one of the closest airports to my childhood home. We wanted to have a nice dinner and do some sightseeing in Montreal before heading continuing our journey home for the holidays. We were scheduled to land in Montreal on that Wednesday night around 6:30 PM EST. We were delayed 3 different times, now making our departure from Tampa around 8 PM EST. During the boarding process Air Canada’s computer software needed to be restated and all passports had to be manually typed into their system. Because boarding took so long, we were now not leaving until about 8:45 PM EST. As my boyfriend and I were sitting in our seats waiting to taxi out to the runway, the captain came on and told the plane “The wing has been damaged. We are not sure if we will be able to fly or if it can be fixed. Well let you know as soon as possible”. We waited at the gate, with little to no communication from the airline crew for over 2 1/2 hours. At one point I walked back to use the airplane restroom and one of the stewardesses was laying down across the empty row of seats trying to sleep. We finally left Tampa after 11 PM EST and arrived in Montreal after 3 AM EST. We were scheduled to fly out of Montreal back to Tampa on the 26th of December. Christmas morning I received the email from Air Canada informing me it was time to check into our flight home. When I put in the reference number the email provided me, I kept getting a message that said “Sorry we are unable to process your request at this time”. I knew something was wrong since the tickets in my Air Canada app were now missing. We both called Air Canada and waited on the phone for over 4+ hours before speaking to a person. Air Canada informed us that our trip was canceled by them because we had “no showed” for our initial flight to Montreal. I have two claim numbers for the initial flight to Montreal for reimbursement for being delayed 9+ hours, and I have receipts from the food that we bought on the flight there. Our passports were scanned 3 separate times by Air Canada personnel. When we said that this incident caused by Air Canadas personnel was a huge breach of Canadas National security, they simply agreed as if it was not a big deal. You can’t let people on a plane without knowing who they are! Air Canada told us it was our fault that we had missed the flight, even though we have proof we were on the flight. They informed us that they would not be looking at the information to prove we were on the initial flight and that they would not be helping us get home to Tampa. We were on our own.

"✅Trip Verified|  Worst flight experience I have had. My flight has already been cancelled twice due to weather conditions when other planes flying to Vancouver the same time as me are able to somehow board and take off. During my second rebooked flight, I went to the airport, was notified of a 4 hour delay, and after waiting the full 4 hours plus the 2 hours it takes me to go through checkin and security, they announce the flight is cancelled. I then have to line up in customer service for more than 8 hours just to claim my baggage and rebook a ticket. No hotel accommodations of any sort whatsoever and my next flight is booked 4 days later! Not to mention customer service closes at 11:30pm and there were hundreds of people in line behind me who are potentially unable to claim their baggage at all. The staff is incredibly disorganized with many staff not able to provide up to date information as they are not informed as well. There is no way of rebooking cancelled tickets online or through phone (as Air Canada is not taking calls), the only way is to stand in line for hours at an airport with no guarantee of possibly any rebooking at all as all the flights are overbooked. It’s absolutely disgusting how Air Canada treats their customers.",worst flight experi flight alreadi cancel twice due weather condit plane fli vancouv time abl somehow board take second rebook flight went airport notifi hour delay wait full hour plu hour take go checkin secur announc flight cancel line custom servic hour claim baggag rebook ticket hotel accommod sort whatsoev next flight book day later mention custom servic close pm hundr peopl line behind potenti unabl claim baggag staff incred disorgan mani staff abl provid date inform inform well way rebook cancel ticket onlin phone air canada take call way stand line hour airport guarante possibl rebook flight overbook absolut disgust air canada treat custom

"Not Verified|  Worst experience flying I have had. Multiple flight cancellations, left stranded at the airport, no one at the information desk, and it takes an average of 2 hours on hold for anyone to pick up the phone from customer service. No respect for anyone’s time from Air Canada. My flight from Detroit to Toronto was delayed multiple times, it was canceled and no one at the front desk could help, all they could offer was “call Air Canada”. After being on hold for an hour and 45 mins, someone could finally be bothered to pick up the phone. The best they could offer was a flight the next morning. My original flight was at 6AM. They didn’t offer me any accommodation and I would be spending over 24 hours at the airport. Fine. I wait. Only for the next morning to roll around and they messed up the booking so my connection takes off before i get there. Another 2 hours on hold before i can talk to someone at “customer service”. Then they put me on a flight to Seattle to make it to Vancouver that same day. I arrive at Seattle and flight to Vancouver has been cancelled and moved to the next day. Currently still on hold with Air Canada. Tried talking to the guy at the kiosk but he was “busy” and then he just left.

First flight from Boston was delayed and they told us 2 hours before, arrived to Canada rushing to make the connection flight when they told me that flight has been canceled, due to crew constraints. They lost my luggage, rescheduled a full day. Between looking for luggage and rescheduling, I waited from 7 pm to 1:30 am to be able to leave the airport to the hotel. I arrive the next day and that next flight is also delayed (2 hours before departure) because of pilot scheduling issues, as if they just found out about this trip. Super inconsiderate for people's limited vacation time. I got this ticket months in advance calculating my vacation days just so I can spend them at airports, baggage claims and desk assistance. Theres also no one to call, and they consider themselves not responsible for these cancelations/ delays because I booked with a booking agency.

"Not Verified|  Terrible experience. My flight was delayed due to delay in fuelling the aircraft, two hours delay. As a result I missed my connecting flight to Montreal. Thankfully the connection flight was also Air Canada, and they automatically booked my to a next day flight. However, the problem is that they didn’t give me an option to choose which flight I wanted to get rebooked on, there was no need to book it for the next day as there was another Air Canada flight in 1.5 hours. They allowed other people to rebook to this 1.5 hours flight leaving same day, but they didn’t allow me, the reason they gave me was that they cannot transfer my luggage in 1.5 hours to this flight. How is it that in my earlier travels they have transferred my luggage with 45 minutes layover and they were not able to do this time in 1.5 hours. They had themselves decided which flight I should get rebooked on (in this case it was next day) and they weren’t ready to listen to any logical reasoning from customer. The lady at customer service was angry as to why I am not waiting in line, but she wasn’t listening to the fact that there were 50 people waiting in the line and if I waited the 1.5 hours flight would have been missed. She wasn’t listening to me at all, and calling my behaviour unacceptable and threatening to call security. I was in tears.

"✅Trip Verified|  I specifically booked my last overseas flight to Canada on another airline, hoping to avoid Air Canada. Only after I paid was I informed that the 2nd and longest leg of my flight was operated by Air Canada.  None of my experience involves any delays or unexpected problems. It was a totally on schedule and uneventful flight. But the service on board is so atrocious. My husband and I, both Canadian and totally fluent in English, were constantly amazed at the rude behavior of every flight attendant on our side in economy class. Every simple and humble request for normal things like a cup of water, a blanket, were met with scorn and loud chastisements. The not-Canadian lady sitting next to me, who was extremely polite, was shocked at every interaction with the flight attendants.  Air Canada flight attendants have increasingly become the worst ambassadors for the country.  have flown all over the world with dozens of different airlines for the last 30 years, and can safely say that Air Canada has the rudest flight attendants I have ever experienced.

"✅Trip Verified| I was incredibly disappointed in this airline. The seats on this plane were incredibly squished together, small and absolutely not realistic for someone to sit in or get any sleep on a 15 hr flight. I know this is common among most airlines but it felt especially squished together more than I’ve experienced on other international flights. I noticed they added another seat to each row. I remember last time I travelled it was 2 on the window sides and 3 in the middle, I noticed that has changed from 3 on the window sides and 4 or 5 in the middle. Then to make things even worse the food was inedible. I’m not expecting a lobster meal or anything and I eat almost anything but that food was disgusting and also in unusual small portions. So not only couldn’t I sleep, stretch my legs out reasonably (causing cramping and pain) but I also hardly ate for 15 hrs. That is cruel to do to their passengers. And in order to get a situation with decent food and comfortable seating, you have to pay hundreds of dollars more. On my flight home from Auckland to Vancouver, there were two seats in front of me that we’re the first row with extra legroom compared to the other seats. Before take off I asked the stewardess if I could sit in those seats since they were empty and in a very snarky tone he told me that passengers pay extra for those and you have to do that ahead of time. I straight up told him I’ll pay for it and he said it was too late. When I was booking the flight that option was already taken so there is no way I could have booked it before hand. I sat for 15 hrs staring at these seats with reasonable leg room right in front of me for my whole flight and it was infuriating. They wouldn’t even let this poor single mom with a baby sit there. I believe making people live in these conditions on a 15 hr flight is cruel and I hope that Air Canada and other airlines change these elitist and exploitive practices of business.",incred disappoint airlin seat plane incred squish togeth small absolut realist someon sit get sleep hr flight know common among airlin felt especi squish togeth experienc intern flight notic ad anoth seat row rememb last time travel window side middl notic chang window side middl make thing even wors food ined expect lobster meal anyth eat almost anyth food disgust also unusu small portion sleep stretch leg reason caus cramp pain also hardli ate hr cruel passeng order get situat decent food comfort seat pay hundr dollar flight home auckland vancouv two seat front first row extra legroom compar seat take ask stewardess could sit seat sinc empti snarki tone told passeng pay extra ahead time straight told pay said late book flight option alreadi taken way could book hand sat hr stare seat reason leg room right front whole flight infuri even let poor singl mom babi sit believ make peopl live condit hr flight cruel hope air canada airlin chang elitist exploit practic busi

At the check-in, I asked that my check-in luggage be tagged to my final destination (Star Alliance). The check-in clerk said no. He called his manager who also said no. Reason was a change of policy less than a month ago. No prior communication to customers and when I asked to clarify the policy, the clerk said I don’t know. So when I arrived to LHR I have to go through immigration and customs, pick up my luggage and go to the check in counter, security, etc. I will probably missed my connection.

Now and they have not gotten back to me. I was able to just get them to rebook it over the phone. Then it was canceled and changed to a time that doesn't work for me. Along with that I had to book 2 other accompanying tickets. Website wasn't working so I called. After more than an hour of waiting I spoke to someone who spelled my name wrong so she had to cancel my whole booking. By the time she went to rebook, my original flight was $200 more per ticket. Said there wasn't anything they could do. Now I have a minor traveling alone because we already changed that ticket to match ours before they canceled.

"✅Trip Verified| Scammed by booking a non-stop flight that actually had a connection: I checked the flight online and booked the ticket through Air Canada's customer service over the phone. Everywhere it was written that it's a direct, non-stop flight flight, both ways. Even the customer service representative did not give us any additional details. After boarding the flight, we found out that the flight actually has a connection through Sao Paolo (GRU) where we needed to get off, pass through airport security and board the aircraft again. The ticket and booking confirmation did not specify any of these details. To our dismay, there were people who would board the plane from those connections and get better seats where we never got the chance to select our seats again. If it were considered a legit connection as it should have been, then we may have been able to select better seats for some parts of the flight. I believe Air Canada did this intentionally to boost their flights ratings on search engines like Google Flight so that their flight shows up above other airlines' flights who actually show a stopover. They can also charge a higher price by claiming this to be a non-stop flight. This is essentially scamming the customers. Horrible food: Their food was also horrible as usual. The chicken sandwich was cold and stale. The food was so bad that on our way back, we actually had dinner at GRU airport. That return flight's food was actually worse. I had to ask for a different menu item because the pancakes were as dry as the Atacama Desert. Narrower seats: Since they cannot reduce the leg space further because then passengers will have to stand throughout the flight, they narrowed the width of the seats to fit at least one more seat in each row in the economy section. It was pretty much impossible to turn on your sides, do anything that required some mobility or even sleep properly. The most difficult exercise was eating. There was no room to keep your hands at the minimum angle required to even use knife and fork properly to cut and eat food. My photos show the evidence. Usually the food tray would have enough space for the meal tray and a cup. However, if you want to keep the meal tray properly, you won't get any space to put the cup and vice versa. Such a shame for a company that's Canada's flagship carrier and has monopoly over flight routes.",scam book non stop flight actual connect check flight onlin book ticket air canada custom servic phone everywher written direct non stop flight flight way even custom servic repres give us addit detail board flight found flight actual connect sao paolo gru need get pass airport secur board aircraft ticket book confirm specifi detail dismay peopl would board plane connect get better seat never got chanc select seat consid legit connect may abl select better seat part flight believ air canada intent boost flight rate search engin like googl flight flight show airlin flight actual show stopov also charg higher price claim non stop flight essenti scam custom horribl food food also horribl usual chicken sandwich cold stale food bad way back actual dinner gru airport return flight food actual wors ask differ menu item pancak dri atacama desert narrow seat sinc cannot reduc leg space passeng stand throughout flight narrow width seat fit least one seat row economi section pretti much imposs turn side anyth requir mobil even sleep properli difficult exercis eat room keep hand minimum angl requir even use knife fork properli cut eat food photo show evid usual food tray would enough space meal tray cup howev want keep meal tray properli get space put cup vice versa shame compani canada flagship carrier monopoli flight rout

"✅Trip Verified|  We originally booked and paid for a direct flight to Barcelona, where we were to board a cruise ship. Air Canada cancelled that flight only 2 days after we paid for it, and bounced us around on at least 3 other non-direct routes, but never offered a refund for the lower priced tickets. This final flight, via Lisbon, had a 75 minute window to connect on Air Portugal flight 2676. About 24 hours prior to departure from Toronto, we received an email announcing that the flight from Toronto to Lisbon would be 45 minutes late leaving Toronto. Once in Lisbon, we found out that Air Portugal had a second flight to Barcelona about 2 hours later. Air Canada should have made that our connecting flight from the very start. With about 2 dozen fellow passengers from the Air Canada flight scrambling to get to Barcelona, that later Air Portugal flight was quickly full. We did not get tickets for that flight. There was absolutely NO Air Canada presence in the Lisbon Airport, and Air Portugal denied any and all responsibility to even assist us. More like “Star Non-Alliance” from our perspective. A Portugal police officer, stationed at the airport, was the only person who gave us assistance during our 17 hours stuck there. With the help of Holland America, we finally got a midnight flight to Malaga Spain and joined the cruise ship two days late. A loss of almost $2,000 for the two of us. Air Canada responded to my detailed inquiry with an unsigned form letter stating that the delay was not their fault. To me, it smacked of arrogance. Check out Air Canada’s FAQs on their web site. Read their definition of how they calculate a mechanical delay at the origin if it happens to subsequently coincide with a weather delay at the destination.

✅Trip Verified|  My girlfriend and I changed our booking prior to our flight and we have a reciept saying we should get 100 euros refund as a result of us changing the booking. We have waited 5 months so far and have not received a cent. We have contacted air Canada several times to ask where the money is at. The first time we were told it would arrive shortly. The second time we were thrown around between different people until we got hung up on out of nothing. The third time today I called in and asked where the money was at and now they say my name isn't even the one on the ticket and booking reference I've made. They refuse to receive my boarding pass and receipts which state that the ticket is of course mine. As to the actual experience flying with Air Canada I do not have anything positive to say. Our food was extremely small portions and very bland. I would not recommend buying anything through Air Canada if you can avoid to do so.,girlfriend chang book prior flight reciept say get euro refund result us chang book wait month far receiv cent contact air canada sever time ask money first time told would arriv shortli second time thrown around differ peopl got hung noth third time today call ask money say name even one ticket book refer made refus receiv board pass receipt state ticket cours mine actual experi fli air canada anyth posit say food extrem small portion bland would recommend buy anyth air canada avoid
"Not Verified|  Just a horrible airline, very bad service, very expensive, old airplanes, dirty and fallen apart seats, rude staff. They need to learn from some airlines like Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways or even Aeromexico. My last trip with Air Canada was an embarrassment, they charged travelers a 1 cad for earphone and serving water from this dollars store 1.5 litre of water, very embarrassing. I misplaced my credit card and I only had my debit card on me and I wanted to pay for the earphone, the flight attendant handed them to me and proceeded to get the payment but apparently their payment system doesn't accept debit cards, so she told me that my payment wasn't accepted and asked me hand back the earphone. A nice lady behind was a witness to this surrealistic situation and paid for my earphones, I fly at least 3 times a year for many years and I always avoided Air Canada until then, to me its an airline from the stone age.",horribl airlin bad servic expens old airplan dirti fallen apart seat rude staff need learn airlin like turkish airlin qatar airway even aeromexico last trip air canada embarrass charg travel cad earphon serv water dollar store litr water embarrass misplac credit card debit card want pay earphon flight attend hand proceed get payment appar payment system accept debit card told payment accept ask hand back earphon nice ladi behind wit surrealist situat paid earphon fli least time year mani year alway avoid air canada airlin stone age

They also did not give an option to pay online which would have been less for me but at airport they have charged 8500 (142 CAD). This is total daylight robbery. I would never opt for Air Canada next time. Poor Support. Also another support person mentioned that passenger has to get second boarding pass at Frankfurt (transit) which gave me more panic. And that is again not true. Lufthansa issued both boarding pass at Chennai (MAA). Support is totally not aware of any of the airline policies and also they want to rob ppl at their throat.

"Not Verified|  This was our worst experience ever. Air Canada did not do its job well. The flight was just sitting on the runway for an hour at the Toronto airport. When we booked the flight and given the itinerary, it was just a 45 minutes technical stop over at London for which we were not required to offboard the aircraft. It was announced that we need to offboard and there is a lay over of 2.5 hours. We had to go through all the security checkins again. They did not start boarding until 25 minutes and then when we asked, they said it’s delayed for 2.5 hours due to technical issues. Again until 35 minutes before the scheduled time they did not start boarding. The staff at the gate did not have any clues about flight time. So many people missed connecting flight from Mumbai. Our bags did not arrive at Mumbai airport. Overall the whole flight experience was a big mess. Air Canada needs to show a responsible behavior and notify customers in advance if they already have such plans of extended pay over.",worst experi ever air canada job well flight sit runway hour toronto airport book flight given itinerari minut technic stop london requir offboard aircraft announc need offboard lay hour go secur checkin start board minut ask said delay hour due technic issu minut schedul time start board staff gate clue flight time mani peopl miss connect flight mumbai bag arriv mumbai airport overal whole flight experi big mess air canada need show respons behavior notifi custom advanc alreadi plan extend pay

"✅Trip Verified|  I travelled from Charlottetown, PEI to Dallas via Montreal. My first experience was pretty good. My return flight was Dallas Fortworth to Charlottetown via Toronto Pearson Airport. My dallas flight experience was good. My troubles started when flight to Charlottetown from Toronto got delayed and later got cancelled. I received a message that my Charlottetown flight got cancelled. To know my options I approached a Air Canada personnel near the gate. That person suggested to contact Customer relations on Level 2 near escalators. I waited in que for 2 hours and want to know my options. One more personnel came to us that Customer relations at that place were overwhelmed and We need to see another customer support team on Level 3 at Toronto Pearson Airport. Me and some other folks came to see Level 3 customer support team as instructed and Customer support team said to us that they are not aware why we are standing in line. Before making this announcement, we waiting in line for almost 1 hour. When it is my turn, I asked the front desk attendant what are my available options as I need to attend work tomorrow. If I get refund, I would like to make a reservation with another carrier. She yelled at me and said that they don't handle refunds and I should email or contact online. I went online where I made my initial reservation and It doesn't give me an option to cancel the flight. Instead it checked me in for another flight on the next day without my approval. In the website, it clearly says ""If you are at the airport, see a customer service personnel and they will gladly help with changes"". They made me speak with a manager and his advise was that I have only one option. My next flight was more than 12 hours. They didn't offer hotel rooms or food vouchers. Instead they suggested me to reserve a hotel room and they will refund up to $300. They said Air Canada ran out of hotel rooms in big city like Toronto but as a individual I should be able to book room on my own. I should make my own to and fro arrangements from the airport to the hotel room. I felt disappointed for purchasing a expensive ticket with them. They treat their customers like shit and has no respect. If they delay your trip, you should be fine with their decisions even if it means that you can attend your job and lose your pay.

The quality of food and presentation was not impressive with not much flavor though ample enough to fill you up. Drinks were plenty. The lighting in the business cabin was relaxing.

"✅Trip Verified|  I am extremely dissatisfied with Air Canada. Besides the flight attendants themselves on the plane, the rest of the experience was awful. It began when my friend accidentally put down my nick name, ""Chase"" instead of Charles on my boarding pass. When we attempted to change, we ended up having to ""upgrade"" all 3 tickets for over $3500 and we didn't even get ""upgraded"" seats. I understand that is an error on our side, but I find it absurd that it cost everyone that much for one name change and  that we couldn't just upgrade one ticket instead of all 3. Also, the agent I spoke with on the phone was very rude, as was his supervisor. After I was told that everything was clear and I was good to go with my flight. I was woken up in the middle of the night (the morning of our flight) and told that I needed to get up and send more documents over. Next, while we were at the airport, the customer service agents at the desk were rude from checking in our bags, to the service desk in the terminal. Our flight was delayed twice (understandable), but when we approached the counter to ask about our connection that we were going to miss, we were told, ""go sit down, we have to go on our break right now"" and they two agents grabbed their stuff and walked off. We were left not knowing what was going on at the gate because the screen at the gate still read the previous flight's info the entire time we were sitting at the gate.",extrem dissatisfi air canada besid flight attend plane rest experi aw began friend accident put nick name chase instead charl board pass attempt chang end upgrad ticket even get upgrad seat understand error side find absurd cost everyon much one name chang upgrad one ticket instead also agent spoke phone rude supervisor told everyth clear good go flight woken middl night morn flight told need get send document next airport custom servic agent desk rude check bag servic desk termin flight delay twice understand approach counter ask connect go miss told go sit go break right two agent grab stuff walk left know go gate screen gate still read previou flight info entir time sit gate

Two of our bags were found and sent over to Vancouver but only only one bag was then received at our hotel on day 3. AC airport baggage staff told us that only one bag was sent over but luckily we had a chip in that second bag and could see that it was at the Vancouver airport and after getting senior service staff involved we received our bag out of the lost baggage area. The third bag wasn't located whilst we were in Vancouver and was only received back in Brisbane in October. We put a claim into AC for the expenses incurred because of the delayed/lost bags and it has been two months and still nothing from them. I can understand bags going astray but it was the complete debacle around finding them and then getting them to us that amazed us. They push bags into the lost baggage area but don't take any details down so when they go looking for your bag they are looking for a black bag amongst the other hundreds of black bags.,august flew sydney vancouv three bag come us two bag found sent vancouv one bag receiv hotel day ac airport baggag staff told us one bag sent luckili chip second bag could see vancouv airport get senior servic staff involv receiv bag lost baggag area third bag locat whilst vancouv receiv back brisban octob put claim ac expens incur delay lost bag two month still noth understand bag go astray complet debacl around find get us amaz us push bag lost baggag area take detail go look bag look black bag amongst hundr black bag

"✅Trip Verified| Terrible Experience. Except for the in-flight staff. They seem to be trying to do a good job. Our trip had 4 flights from Calgary to Toronto to Windsor Ontario and back. Fog in Toronto led to a cancelled flight. Rebooked for the next day, then cancelled again and rebooked for the day of the return flight. No way to contact anyone for support. Took the train to Windsor or we would have missed the wedding we were travelling for. Then on the return trip, just a comedy of delays. Delays in the terminal, then 90+ min in the plane, while they waited for additional passengers, then they swapped out pilots, then we waited for the ground crew to return, then more new passengers, then replay all the safety info, etc etc. etc. We did finally get back to Calgary. The plane was nice, but the airline has clearly lost contact with its customers. There is no attention to the customer's experience and no regard for delivering on what they sell. Their focus is on limiting costs and increasing revenue - only. I'm just glad we managed our risk by limiting our luggage to carry-on only. I am highly reticent to travel with Air Canada, as each time I've flown with them I've had the same bad experiences of overbooked and cancelled flights.

The Toronto Maple Leaf Lounge was comfortable with some excellent food on offer and I was able to find a very comfortable chair and get some work done. The flight was delayed a little but we arrived in Vancouver on-time. Overall it was a smooth ride with little turbulence. The Dreamliner is a very comfortable quiet plane and one of my favorites in the Air Canada fleet. The staff were friendly and attentive. I like the Air Canada app as I was able to pick out the films I wanted to watch and I appreciated all the choices. There are quite a few I look forward to watching on my next flight. It was great having access to wifi. Dinner and the wine were excellent. I appreciate I can review the menu on the Air Canada app before the flight.

"✅Trip Verified|  A letter I just sent to Air Canada. I think it pretty much summarizes my feelings for them at the moment. ------ Hello, I am still waiting for a status update for this case. We have been now waiting over 90 days for communication from Air Canada. We cannot check the status of our claim because we are now receiving the message ""Access to your file is no longer available. Please contact your airline for more information"". Please expedite this request. We need to talk somebody in regards to this claim. COVID is no longer an excuse for how poorly Air Canada manages customer luggage. For Air Canada, customer satisfaction now seems like an afterthought, which is why we will likely never fly with Air Canada again.

"Not Verified|  I am highly disappointed, frustrated, and traumatized by Air Canada. My flight from Cairo, Egypt to Toronto, Canada was a normal flight. We arrived to Toronto to take another flight to San Francisco. With 10+ hours of flying and only 1 hour to go to our next flight, you can imagine the exhaustion we had. We asked the workers if they can let us surpass the long line but they rudely told us to wait like everyone else. My family and I (which was 8 of us total) got in line. It was our turn to get inspected and we got through somewhat, however we had the concern that our gate was already opening. After the inspection, we had to wait just outside of it where there was a screen to wait for our names to turn green as they were x-raying our luggages to get to the US. With the last minutes of our gate closing, our concern grew and we were starting to panic because our names have not turned green yet. Not one worker helped us get to our gate and it seemed they did not care if we missed our flight. We ended up missing our flight and they told us to get to an air canada desk (which they were not specific about where this was). All of us ran through everywhere to find a desk and the workers were extremely rude and uncooperative about looking for a flight. They finally told us we had to get through the immigration customs, to get to an air canada desk to rebook our flights. We got through the immigration customs and we had to pick up our luggages. We face another issue where we could not find them. We initially thought they were on the flight we missed but fortunately they were just misplaced. We wait 30 minutes for them to give our luggages and once we get them we go to the desk. We get there and we are greeted rudely by an air canada employee where she tells one of my family members in a nasty attitude ""where does the line start?!"", implying that we should move out of the way so that other customers can be helped. We told her she was being rude and she denied it. Still, we moved out the way. An employee helped rebook our flights but we all had to get separated but at that point we did not care. They gave each one of us a hotel and meal vouchers but not to me  (which at the time i didn't check). So I had to pay for my meal which was $50. The next day we all take our flight but the last 4 of us faced the same issues as the prior situation. We fly to Montreal with no issues, but yet again we had to go through a long line to get inspected and wait in front of a screen to wait for our names to pop up. We had 2 hours for our gate to open so I thought it would be a quick wait since this should not happen for the 2nd time to us! But I was wrong. Before our flight departed, I go up to the desk and tell them why our names has not been called and they tell us they thought we each had 2 luggages but we had 1 each. That was the whole wait up and they had to make sure the system says we are in the clear but through all that we miss our flight while heading to the next long line to immigration. So, we go back and they help us rebook our flight within the next hour and hasten ourselves because we are already traumatized that we will miss our flight for the 3rd time. We get to our gate as they were calling the last of the people to get to the plane. We arrive to San Francisco with a huge relief because we are finally home! But of course, they lose our luggage. But the only good thing is that they returned them to our homes 2 days later.",highli disappoint frustrat traumat air canada flight cairo egypt toronto canada normal flight arriv toronto take anoth flight san francisco hour fli hour go next flight imagin exhaust ask worker let us surpass long line rude told us wait like everyon els famili us total got line turn get inspect got somewhat howev concern gate alreadi open inspect wait outsid screen wait name turn green x ray luggag get us last minut gate close concern grew start panic name turn green yet one worker help us get gate seem care miss flight end miss flight told us get air canada desk specif us ran everywher find desk worker extrem rude uncoop look flight final told us get immigr custom get air canada desk rebook flight got immigr custom pick luggag face anoth issu could find initi thought flight miss fortun misplac wait minut give luggag get go desk get greet rude air canada employe tell one famili member nasti attitud line start impli move way custom help told rude deni still move way employe help rebook flight get separ point care gave one us hotel meal voucher time check pay meal next day take flight last us face issu prior situat fli montreal issu yet go long line get inspect wait front screen wait name pop hour gate open thought would quick wait sinc happen nd time us wrong flight depart go desk tell name call tell us thought luggag whole wait make sure system say clear miss flight head next long line immigr go back help us rebook flight within next hour hasten alreadi traumat miss flight rd time get gate call last peopl get plane arriv san francisco huge relief final home cours lose luggag good thing return home day later
"Not Verified|  On October 20, 2022, my wife and I arrived at Raleigh Durham Airport (RDU) to take Air Canada flight 8839 to Toronto, connecting to Dubai. I was with a group of about 20. My experience there was the worst I have ever encountered while traveling. There were in fact 5 major problems I encountered trying to get tickets I had already paid for. 1. I tried to check in online the day before but their system wouldn’t let me. I then called Air Canada and was on hold for 4 hours. When someone finally answered, she told be to try again 24 hours before the second flight. That didn’t work either. 2. Since system did not allow me or many others to check in online, I showed up early, at 2:00 pm. They told us we had no tickets, we were not in the system. The same thing happened with another couple we were traveling with. After 20 minutes and several phone calls they said we had tickets. 3. Then they said we had to get an app and fill out a Covid form for Dubai. They had previously told our trip leader this wasn’t necessary, so none of us were prepared. The app worked poorly and I got locked out with the app saying I could only redo in 24 hours. Air Canada then told me they not give me a ticket. I eventually redid the app and change to my wife’s phone number. I later talked to fellow travelers in our group who took a different airline that did not require this app. 4. With a working app, I went again to the counter for my tickets. This time they told me they couldn’t scan my and my wife’s passports. No one else had this problem, and I didn’t have this problem 3 months earlier when flying on Air Canada. They had to call their office and after 40 minutes they manually got it to work. 5. I was so relieved to finally have tickets I didn’t look at where the seats were. We had previously paid $234 for seats that were next to each other. The ones we got on the two flights out were not next to each other, and the one on the flight back was next to each other but middle seats we didn’t order. Air Canada owes me $234 for not giving me the seats I paid for. I don’t want a credit because I am never flying this airline again but I'm sure that's what I'll get. During the leg to Dubai all 3 bathrooms on the of the plane left were out. Also, the movie I was watching was lost after a pilot announcement. This happened to many others too. In Raleigh, there were 3 times I was very worried I would not make it on the plane for a trip I had paid a lot of money for. This was a scarring experience and two weeks later I am still very upset.",octob wife arriv raleigh durham airport rdu take air canada flight toronto connect dubai group experi worst ever encount travel fact major problem encount tri get ticket alreadi paid tri check onlin day system let call air canada hold hour someon final answer told tri hour second flight work either sinc system allow mani other check onlin show earli pm told us ticket system thing happen anoth coupl travel minut sever phone call said ticket said get app fill covid form dubai previous told trip leader necessari none us prepar app work poorli got lock app say could redo hour air canada told give ticket eventu redid app chang wife phone number later talk fellow travel group took differ airlin requir app work app went counter ticket time told scan wife passport one els problem problem month earlier fli air canada call offic minut manual got work reliev final ticket look seat previous paid seat next one got two flight next one flight back next middl seat order air canada owe give seat paid want credit never fli airlin sure get leg dubai bathroom plane left also movi watch lost pilot announc happen mani other raleigh time worri would make plane trip paid lot money scar experi two week later still upset

"✅Trip Verified|  After reading so many negative reviews, I was nervous about my flights on Air Canada. However, my experience was quite positive. A slight schedule change was communicated to me weeks ahead of the flight via my 3rd party agent. My flights were basically on schedule. On my 8 hour flight Tokyo to Vancouver, I had 2 full meals that were as good as any other economy class meal. While cabin crew didn't walk around offering extra water, they were quick to respond when I asked for water. Entertainment options were satisfactory. On my super short flight Vancouver to Portland, pretzels and cold beverages were provided. My experiences were much more positive than I expected.",read mani neg review nervou flight air canada howev experi quit posit slight schedul chang commun week ahead flight via rd parti agent flight basic schedul hour flight tokyo vancouv full meal good economi class meal cabin crew walk around offer extra water quick respond ask water entertain option satisfactori super short flight vancouv portland pretzel cold beverag provid experi much posit expect

Then we get to airport in Canada we have to go thru customs and security again! The workers were only letting certain people skip the line so everyone who was missing their flights were angry and confused why they were not permitted to skip the line. People whose flight left after us were getting to skip the line. We finally had to grab someone and get to the front of line. Then they said your luggage isn't there yet so you cant get on flight you have to wait. Then they didn't tell us when it said it made it thru. Of course our gate was the last gate at the end of everything and we missed our flight. The ""customer service agent"" rebooked us 4 hour later. No seat together, no we're sorry seat upgrade.

"Not Verified| Our recent experience on Air Canada is the worst I have had in decades of flying. One should never book on that wretched airline. The problems arose when we were changing planes in Toronto after flying Air Canada from Europe. The flight from to Toronto was a bit late but there was still ample time for us to go through customs and all the other steps and make our connection to go home. But, Air Canada had bumped us from that flight to the same flight the next day. Even though we got to the gate for our flight home in ample time and there were seats on the plane, Air Canada refused to let us on, because, they said, our bags wouldn’t make the connection. (They easily could have made the connection had the airline tried. In fact, it seems that one of our bags did make the connection.) We said that we wanted very much to fly home then and that we’d pick up our bags the next day if they did not make the flight with us. The airline refused, including appeals to various higher ups. So, we had to waste a day at a lousy airport hotel when we needed to be home for medicine, our pet, etc. This was inexcusable. Moreover, we heard others having like awful experiences with this airline (on our flight and on others) while we were in the customer service line and at the hotel. Apparently, this airline bumps people all the time for poor reasons. To top that off, with one exception (the man at the gate to our home airport, who tried to get permission to let us on the plane), the staff was worse than useless. Every step took way longer than it should have and they had no sense of helping the much inconvenienced customers. (The woman who told us we had been bumped when we got off the plane from Rome replied, when I said we needed to get home for medicine and our pet, “the airline doesn’t care”.) Everything was extreme bureaucracy and rigidity and a lack of anything resembling competence or due process.",recent experi air canada worst decad fli one never book wretch airlin problem aros chang plane toronto fli air canada europ flight toronto bit late still ampl time us go custom step make connect go home air canada bump us flight flight next day even though got gate flight home ampl time seat plane air canada refus let us said bag make connect easili could made connect airlin tri fact seem one bag make connect said want much fli home pick bag next day make flight us airlin refus includ appeal variou higher up wast day lousi airport hotel need home medicin pet etc inexcus moreov heard other like aw experi airlin flight other custom servic line hotel appar airlin bump peopl time poor reason top one except man gate home airport tri get permiss let us plane staff wors useless everi step took way longer sens help much inconvenienc custom woman told us bump got plane rome repli said need get home medicin pet airlin care everyth extrem bureaucraci rigid lack anyth resembl compet due process
"✅Trip Verified|  Never going to travel through Air Canada again. They made me pay $34 for my carry on baggage and that’s the bag I always carry when I travel. Never had any issues with any other airline. Most of the people around me had the standard sized carry on baggage which just couldn’t fit in their bag sizer. It was probably their strategy to make more money. The lineups to check in my bag were crazy and the staff was horrible. They were extremely unhelpful and their kiosks were not user friendly at all.

"Not Verified|  Flew with family for a vacation in Portugal leaving late June 2022, returning early July 2022. Original itinerary was round trip from Newark to Lisbon flying via Montreal on Air Canada. On day of departure our flight from Newark to Montreal was cancelled without any notice. We found out when we went to the airport. Initially Air Canada rebooked us on a flight with another airline, but when we went to check in with that airline we were told their flight was already full. Next Air Canada rebooked us to fly to Lisbon via Toronto. We arrived in Toronto but the flight from Toronto to Lisbon was delayed and then cancelled at 1:00 am. Air Canada customer service manager at Toronto announced the cancellation and said we were free to make our own hotel arrangements and that we could submit a claim for reimbursement with Air Canada. Eventually we got to Lisbon the next day. On the return journey, the flight from Lisbon to Montreal arrived close to schedule but delays in the airport meant we missed our flight from Montreal to Newark. Once again, Air Canada announced we could arrange our own hotel room for the overnight delay and submit expenses for reimbursement. Air Canada booked on a flight to Newark the next day with another airline. When we got home, we followed the process on Air Canada's website to request reimbursement and provided all required documentation (flight numbers, receipts, etc.). It took 83 days for Air Canada to respond and inform us that our claim was denied because flight delays and cancellations were due to Covid and safety issues and so did not qualify for compensation. When I responded that we submitted expenses for reimbursement based on airport announcements made by Air Canada at the airport, then came back and reiterated our claim was denied.",flew famili vacat portug leav late june return earli juli origin itinerari round trip newark lisbon fli via montreal air canada day departur flight newark montreal cancel without notic found went airport initi air canada rebook us flight anoth airlin went check airlin told flight alreadi full next air canada rebook us fli lisbon via toronto arriv toronto flight toronto lisbon delay cancel air canada custom servic manag toronto announc cancel said free make hotel arrang could submit claim reimburs air canada eventu got lisbon next day return journey flight lisbon montreal arriv close schedul delay airport meant miss flight montreal newark air canada announc could arrang hotel room overnight delay submit expens reimburs air canada book flight newark next day anoth airlin got home follow process air canada websit request reimburs provid requir document flight number receipt etc took day air canada respond inform us claim deni flight delay cancel due covid safeti issu qualifi compens respond submit expens reimburs base airport announc made air canada airport came back reiter claim deni

"✅Trip Verified|  Flying premium economy with Air Canada exposes you to both economy and premium economy service. It starts out very impressive in the sense that they did a quick beverage service with glassware and real bottles of wine followed by a meal served on porcelain tableware. My understanding is the meal is the same as economy class but it certainly is presented in a nicer way. The portion size might be a bit larger in PE. I was very impressed with how quickly the service began, it seems like we were fed within 20 minutes of the plane taking off. The only disappointment was the indignance of the male flight attendant when I asked him about the difference in the white wine selection. He just couldn’t seem to handle that. Another flight attendant heard his behaviour and came back to ask me how I liked the wine I selected. I thought that was very nice of her. When another flight attendant came to remove my tray and I held on to the wine glass, she asked me if I wanted more. I appreciated that and she even came back one more time to refill. I mention that because this distinguished PE from regular economy. The PE seat itself is very comfortable with a pitch of 38 inches. The problem is that you are exposed pretty much to the economy service for the rest of the flight. There are  no snacks in the galley except juice and pretzels and water. It is the same Air Canada pretzels they served before the pandemic. They used to have these biscotti, but they reappeared as part of the snack that was served halfway through the flight with a tuna sandwich. Two meals were served (breakfast before landing), and the breakfast is served as economy class. When meals or the mid-flight snack were not being served, the crew never circulated through the cabin to offer a glass of water. They sat in the galley and people could come and get water or pretzels or ask for juice.",fli premium economi air canada expos economi premium economi servic start impress sens quick beverag servic glasswar real bottl wine follow meal serv porcelain tablewar understand meal economi class certainli present nicer way portion size might bit larger pe impress quickli servic began seem like fed within minut plane take disappoint indign male flight attend ask differ white wine select seem handl anoth flight attend heard behaviour came back ask like wine select thought nice anoth flight attend came remov tray held wine glass ask want appreci even came back one time refil mention distinguish pe regular economi pe seat comfort pitch inch problem expos pretti much economi servic rest flight snack galley except juic pretzel water air canada pretzel serv pandem use biscotti reappear part snack serv halfway flight tuna sandwich two meal serv breakfast land breakfast serv economi class meal mid flight snack serv crew never circul cabin offer glass water sat galley peopl could come get water pretzel ask juic

The flight attendants went into hibernation. They came out of hiding about an hour before we landed and served us breakfast. It consisted of a yogurt and an inedible packaged chocolate filled roll.

"Not Verified| I had only been to Canada once before to Montreal by bus- when I was young and poor - that was a considerably better experience than Air Canada- that is disorganized filled with ambiguous phrase or non-articulated conditions on charging and delays and shamelessly indifferent to customer comfort. I think the Canadian government should look into this company. From a distance I have always had the absolute greatest respect for Canadian culture — this airline is a liability - it has utterly changed my sense of this nation and culture I will certainly never again fly Air Canada - will never come to Toronto again - and will as widely as I can - disperse the information of Air Canada's unrestrained jerking around of its customers — my flight itinerary has been as simple as can be — Toronto NYC - a simple hour and some minutes flight on a Sunday — my flight at 6 am was cancelled - I was on the phone for three hours, three hours wrangling with customer service who seemed to have no authority on what they were doing who were claiming I had to pay to be placed on another flight pay extra in addition to my flight - even though Air Canada had cancelled! What kind of a scam is that? Complete incentive for the airline to cancel on people left and right — Later in the airport an agent informed me that my basic ticket purchase has no “protection” against airline cancellations — completely unregulated unprincipled gouging — I was placed on a flight with a 2:30 departure - that again was cancelled - no COVID congestions no serious weather advisories in Toronto —it is a sunny day —yes the weather is not good in New York but the airport delays are by 15 minutes nothing more serious — over a simple hour flight I have been delayed by 14 hours with the prospect earlier had I not vehemently defended myself of paying for this privilege — REPUGNANT -",canada montreal bu young poor consider better experi air canada disorgan fill ambigu phrase non articul condit charg delay shamelessli indiffer custom comfort think canadian govern look compani distanc alway absolut greatest respect canadian cultur airlin liabil utterli chang sens nation cultur certainli never fli air canada never come toronto wide dispers inform air canada unrestrain jerk around custom flight itinerari simpl toronto nyc simpl hour minut flight sunday flight cancel phone three hour three hour wrangl custom servic seem author claim pay place anoth flight pay extra addit flight even though air canada cancel kind scam complet incent airlin cancel peopl left right later airport agent inform basic ticket purchas protect airlin cancel complet unregul unprincipl goug place flight departur cancel covid congest seriou weather advisori toronto sunni day ye weather good new york airport delay minut noth seriou simpl hour flight delay hour prospect earlier vehement defend pay privileg repugn
"Not Verified|  Flight from LA to Toronto went fine. The problems started when we landed in Toronto. We had a 5-hour layover and were trying to catch an earlier flight. Made it through customs in minutes, looking good to catch the earlier flight. That’s when things went horribly awry. After customs, you get dumped out into the main departures section of the terminal - outside security. Then, after waiting in security line, they test every piece of carry-on luggage. Smallest test rack I have ever seen. I have an internationally sized roller bag and have never had an issue with carry on in any country. In fact, the luggage fit fine on the Air Canada overhead on the first leg of the flight — not in Toronto! Giving up on the earlier fight, we accepted we would need to bag check and head back in through security. At least we could get food or go to an airport lounge. Wrong. Even though Air Canada flew us from LA to Toronto, they treated the second leg of the flight like we just walked in off the street. No checking bags until 4 hours before flight is scheduled to depart. So now we have to wait outside near the main ticket counters for over an hour until we can check our bags. If we had checked our bags in LA, they would have had them off our first plane almost 6 hours before the next flight departed, so they can definitely do it, they just refuse to. So Air Canada changes the carry on rules mid-trip, spits us outside security and won’t do anything to resolve the issue, on a flight and connection they booked.

"✅Trip Verified|  After my travel agent booked my flight, I found out, on the ticket, that I had to pay an extra $75 per suitcase. On my way to Manchester, the plane was late. I was told that the preferred seating (leg room) which I had paid $162 for, one way, was no longer available. After several attempts, the person in charge finally got me a legroom seat after all. On my way back from Manchester to Toronto I got to the airport at about 8;30 am for a 12;30 pm take off and was told the flight was cancelled. We were put up for the night, meals included, in a mediocre hotel. Food was also mediocre. After boarding the plane next day I was told once again that the leg room seat I had paid $149 for was not available. As the plane was not full, the stewardess noted a legroom seat that was unoccupied and said, ""you'd better grab that one, but if someone else claims it, you'll have to move."" I paid a total of $311 extra, on top of my flight for legroom seating and was eventually granted these seats as if it was a favour. Another steward told me to put my mask on as I was taking it off to eat. They were bringing the meals at the time. I ignored her so I could eat. After that she ignored me, not once, but twice, when the drinks trolley was brought along. I had to go after her to request an orange juice. The second time, I had to ask a different stewardess for a cup of tea because madam seemed determined not to serve me, and once again cruised past me, refusing to make eye contact, while I called out to her. Her behaviour was appalling. No one can eat with a mask on, and food and drink service was included in the price of my ticket. Overall, my first experience with Air Canada was not good. And I thought Air Transat was bad.",travel agent book flight found ticket pay extra per suitcas way manchest plane late told prefer seat leg room paid one way longer avail sever attempt person charg final got legroom seat way back manchest toronto got airport pm take told flight cancel put night meal includ mediocr hotel food also mediocr board plane next day told leg room seat paid avail plane full stewardess note legroom seat unoccupi said better grab one someon els claim move paid total extra top flight legroom seat eventu grant seat favour anoth steward told put mask take eat bring meal time ignor could eat ignor twice drink trolley brought along go request orang juic second time ask differ stewardess cup tea madam seem determin serv cruis past refus make eye contact call behaviour appal one eat mask food drink servic includ price ticket overal first experi air canada good thought air transat bad

"✅Trip Verified|  Without question this is the worst long haul flight I have ever taken. I couldn’t believe that for 11 hours we were confined to the limited legroom of a 737. Was the 737 designed for long haul? The first leg of the overnight flight, from Vancouver to Halifax, didn’t serve a meal, but put out the lights and expected us to sleep. During the night we were hungry and thirsty, and had to go to the galley and ask for refreshments. Thank goodness we managed to buy a decent breakfast at Halifax Airport! Then back onto another 737 for the second leg of the flight. The meal offered was small and fairly tasteless (I think the worst I have ever experienced on long haul), and again the need to visit the galley to stay hydrated. The overhead lockers were absolutely jam packed by the time we got seated, and I ended up putting my rucksack under the seat, eating into my already limited legroom. It’s almost impossible to compare Air Canada with other carriers which I use for long haul e.g. BA, Thai, Malaysian, Cathay, Emirates, where the passenger is kept fed and hydrated by attentive staff. When I arrived at Heathrow I took two flights to reach home in northern Scotland- with BA and Loganair.

"Not Verified|  Flew from Toronto to San Francisco, Air Canada was making all passengers place their roller bag and personal items in the baggage sizing tray to make sure they were up to par before letting them proceed to security line, created a long unnecessary line just to size bags and many people were told their personal items were oversized despite clearly being small enough to fit under the seat, and were made to go back to the check-in desk agent to pay 30$ per bag to check in a small personal item (and go through another line, no less). No other airline was doing this except for Air Canada. I travel frequently, approximately every 6 weeks and travel carry-on only, my backpack was also refused despite having taken this backpack on Air Canada and other airlines multiple times before and fitting perfectly well under the seat as my personal item, and when I brought this up to the agent they said 'that was before, we're auditing people now'. Despite being 3 hours early to the airport, we still only made it to our gate 15 mins before boarding because of this unnecessary hassle. The AC agents were so rude, creating unnecessary delays.

Seats in economy are of the type that slide forward when you recline, which limits reclining ability for anyone over 6 feet tall. In practical terms it means leg room is reduced cf. advertised.

"✅Trip Verified|  I flew Dubai-Toronto (4 hour layover) and Toronto-Montreal on June 15th/16th 2022. Two things happened on this trip, first, the Boeing 787-9 (long haul flight) upkeep and comfort was in dark contrast to the Airbus A220-300 used for the 1 hour flight. Yes, the Airbus A220-300 was a much more comfortable flight in everyway. Second, I arrived in Montreal after a very very long journey and had to wait in the understaffed luggage claims line, for another hour, with 30 or so other passengers from exclusively AC flights, all of us with missing luggage, confused and tired. During this wait, we witnessed the comedy act of airport security walling off the luggage carrousel which was overpiling with late / delayed lost baggage. No information was shared other than, we will let you know, enjoy your stay in Canada. After 2 weeks of calling, filing in useless complaints reports on AC's website and making trips to the airport, I was finally re-united with one bag, which was in a 3rd party storage facility a 15 mins drive from the airport, the 2nd bag was delivered the following day. Compensation? fill in another report and attach your receipts (what justification can you give a passenger for delaying their baggage for 2 weeks, I flew to your hub in Toronto for God's sake, the layover was 4 hours how did you misplace the luggage?). During this time all the communication and effort was one way, this is a disgusting level of due diligence from an airline which promotes itself as excellence. This is not excellence, this is utter garbage. On my return flight I flew premium economy, little did I know, I would experience the novelty of skipping a hot meal on a flight for the 1st time in my life, the food was inedible. In September (3 months after my flight) an AC customer service agent emails me stating ''we have decided to compensate you for your 14 day delayed baggage, we are happy to give $400 CAN. $400 CAN for losing my luggage for 2 weeks. On top of that, the customer service agent instructs me to share all, and I mean ALL, of my banking info. so that they could transfer this meagre payoff. Why? They do not have a system which allows transfer's to customer's living abroad.  its 2022, I used a credit card to pay for the flight, all details of which are logged and registered on your system, at least, a normally functioning company's system. I have now spent 2 weeks advising AC that it is unacceptable to make such a statement (international transfers) and unacceptable to ask your passengers to share their bank details online via email.

"✅Trip Verified|  First flight on AC on the route from Frankfurt to Toronto. Overall, it was a solid experience with some light and lots of shadow. The flight was operated by a Boeing 777-200LR with a 3-4-3 seat formation, which is standard today for this type of aircraft, but meant that seats were rather on the narrow side. The legroom was relatively tight. In particular, it bothered me that the life west of the seat in front of me blocked a lot of the room under the seat so that it was difficult to stretch my legs, something I have not experienced on the same type of aircraft with other airlines. However, the recline was fine for a standard economy seat. I did not find the food tasty, and the portions were also rather on the small side. But the service was overall friendly and attentive. There was a bar for (non-alcoholic) drinks during the flight and the cabin attendants occasionally passed through the cabin to offer water. The worst part of the experience was the deplaning: We arrived at the gate half an hour late. It was announced that only connecting passengers should leave the aircraft (regardless of whether they had a tight connection), while everyone else had to stay on board (of course, this was not enforced for Business class passengers). When all the connecting passengers (or those who claimed to be) had left, we had to wait for five minutes (why?), before everyone else could deplane. Overall the process was chaotic and inefficient. It took 20 minutes from arriving at the gate, until I could leave the aircraft even though I was seated at the front of the cabin. Overall, it was by far not my favourite way to cross the Atlantic. Yet, I would probably not mind to fly AC again if the schedule works and the price is right.",first flight ac rout frankfurt toronto overal solid experi light lot shadow flight oper boe lr seat format standard today type aircraft meant seat rather narrow side legroom rel tight particular bother life west seat front block lot room seat difficult stretch leg someth experienc type aircraft airlin howev reclin fine standard economi seat find food tasti portion also rather small side servic overal friendli attent bar non alcohol drink flight cabin attend occasion pass cabin offer water worst part experi deplan arriv gate half hour late announc connect passeng leav aircraft regardless whether tight connect everyon els stay board cours enforc busi class passeng connect passeng claim left wait five minut everyon els could deplan overal process chaotic ineffici took minut arriv gate could leav aircraft even though seat front cabin overal far favourit way cross atlant yet would probabl mind fli ac schedul work price right

The food was probably the worst food i was presented in my life of flying. Poor quality, cold and not edible. I was shocked that on the return 10 hour flight we were given hot poor quality dinner (with solid hard cold bun and butter and tasteless brownie,) soon after take off and then one hour before landing a cold croissant with fruit yogurt (only edible food during the flight).

Normally I used two flights to travel from Brisbane to Minneapolis. But it appeared that this trip had three flights via Canada. All the flights were delayed and we miss the one from Montreal to Minneapolis and had to spend time at the airport over night. The return trip back to Australia was worse; again all flights were delayed over 4 hours and we miss the one from Vancouver to Brisbane. They put us up in a hotel in Vancouver and promised to pay all expenses. But when receipts for expenses were submitted they refused saying that it was due to computer glitches. Moreover, we were put on two flights from Vancouver; one from vancouver Sydney and the other from Sydney to Brisbane which means we had 4 flights from Minneapolis to Brisbane. Each trip took 2 days instead of 1 day. When landed at Brisbane one of luggage was missing and it took 2 days to get it back.

"✅Trip Verified|  The flight and check-in process went well. The information provided in the app was useful, though the seat map displaying which seats are occupied differed between the Air Canada website and the app. During boarding, ground staff grouped zones 4 and 5 together after boarding zone 3, which confused several passengers, including me. There was also a long line in the jet bridge. The cabin was clean and service was friendly and efficient. There was a rude passenger whom the stewardesses dealt with professionally. A stewardess also confirmed a special meal I had requested and was respectful regarding the handling and opening of the meal package. The IFE system in the seat next to mine was broken, which is odd, even for an older 787. Overall, the flight was up to my expectations for an Air Canada economy class flight and was generally average.",flight check process went well inform provid app use though seat map display seat occupi differ air canada websit app board ground staff group zone togeth board zone confus sever passeng includ also long line jet bridg cabin clean servic friendli effici rude passeng stewardess dealt profession stewardess also confirm special meal request respect regard handl open meal packag ife system seat next mine broken odd even older overal flight expect air canada economi class flight gener averag
"Not Verified|  I was expecting the worst when I stepped aboard this 787-8 at EDI. I was the first passenger aboard and there was no one to greet me. After an initial rush of excitement that there was no crew and we would have free run of the aircraft cabin crew dashed up the aisle to greet us, looking slightly surprised that boarding had started without their knowledge. We were shown to our seats, stowed our hand baggage in the 787's massive overhead bins, and settled down. Cabin crew came by to introduce themselves and take our food and beverage orders. There were no pre-departure drinks nor hot towels. I looked at the amenity kit; socks and an eyeshade, unbranded, in a black plastic pouch. I grimaced. We taxied out to the westbound runway and were underway about an hour after scheduled departure time. Drinks service commenced swiftly after takeoff and I was soon enjoying Laurent Perrier brut and a packet of cashews. My eighteen-month old son had fallen asleep in my arms during the take-off run - as one does - and was now sleeping soundly. The purser came and suggested I make use of the empty 1D as a bed for him. Seated in 2A I could just about see his feet if I poked my head over the aisle - the privacy on this configuration of seating is very good. Lunch was served as we climbed out over the Western Isles and was very good. Drinks service was decent throughout the first two hours of the flight and nothing felt rushed, or too much trouble. My woke at about the two hour point and was hungry. The cabin crew swiftly prepared a meal for him and none of it felt like too much trouble at all. After about three hours it was time for bed, with the cabin crew locking the window dimmers and turning off the lights. The fact that it was early afternoon local time and mid morning at destination didn't seem a factor. most of the business class cabin obeyed the crew's wishes and went to sleep. I turned to the entertainment system. While the choice of movies is pretty decent, the decision to include two episodes, mid season, from TV shows is baffling. As is the inclusion of three-hour long music programmes, which must be listened to in entirety with no option to skip to the song you want. Why whole albums can't just be uploaded giving the user the ability to navigate to the music they want to listen to, like almost all airlines do these days, is truly baffling. The entertainment system doesn't feel cheap at all, but this particular part of it felt like it had been beamed in from some tragic charter flight from 1990. After a couple of hours had elapsed the intermission was over and it was time to wake up again. Normal service resumed and we were served a snack of charcuterie, cheeses, bread, and pickles. Soon it was time for landing and we found ourselves back on the ground in Toronto. The cabin crew answered that ""metered deplaning"" was in effect and 50 passengers would be allowed off every five minutes, with connecting passengers taking priority. Although we couldn't provide evidence of having a connection as we hadn't been able to check in online for our onward United flight, the purser let us off anyway. This is clearly a paired back service, with Covid as the excuse. Despite this, the crew made us feel welcome, went the extra mile, and probably broke the rules, all for our comfort.",expect worst step aboard edi first passeng aboard one greet initi rush excit crew would free run aircraft cabin crew dash aisl greet us look slightli surpris board start without knowledg shown seat stow hand baggag massiv overhead bin settl cabin crew came introduc take food beverag order pre departur drink hot towel look amen kit sock eyeshad unbrand black plastic pouch grimac taxi westbound runway underway hour schedul departur time drink servic commenc swiftli takeoff soon enjoy laurent perrier brut packet cashew eighteen month old son fallen asleep arm take run one sleep soundli purser came suggest make use empti bed seat could see feet poke head aisl privaci configur seat good lunch serv climb western isl good drink servic decent throughout first two hour flight noth felt rush much troubl woke two hour point hungri cabin crew swiftli prepar meal none felt like much troubl three hour time bed cabin crew lock window dimmer turn light fact earli afternoon local time mid morn destin seem factor busi class cabin obey crew wish went sleep turn entertain system choic movi pretti decent decis includ two episod mid season tv show baffl inclus three hour long music programm must listen entireti option skip song want whole album upload give user abil navig music want listen like almost airlin day truli baffl entertain system feel cheap particular part felt like beam tragic charter flight coupl hour elaps intermiss time wake normal servic resum serv snack charcuteri chees bread pickl soon time land found back ground toronto cabin crew answer meter deplan effect passeng would allow everi five minut connect passeng take prioriti although provid evid connect abl check onlin onward unit flight purser let us anyway clearli pair back servic covid excus despit crew made us feel welcom went extra mile probabl broke rule comfort
"✅Trip Verified|  The price was affordable but the service was lousy. When I arrived at my final destination I realized that they lost my checked-in baggage for which I paid 250 euros! . At the counter they told me that they would solve my problem in 3 days and I have been waiting almost 1 month for information about my luggage, unbelievable. The customer service is really bad, I had to wait up to 1 hour every day I called to be attended! The other thing I wanted to emphasize was the punctuality of this airline. Unfortunately, I had to fly back with this airline and to make matters worse I missed my last flight connection from Brussels to Hamburg because the plane landed 1 hour late in Brussels.

"✅Trip Verified|  I flew with Air Canada from Vancouver to London Heathrow today (17/09/2022) and I have a 10 hour layover so I thought I would post a return review but it doesn’t get any better than my outbound flight. The Crew were pleasant enough upon boarding and they were more present in the Cabin on the return flight but that’s about it. The menu choices were the same and not appealing. A hot meal was provided but the Continental Breakfast did make everyone laugh. A croissant & a Yogurt. A crew member was later shouting at a passenger when starting approach into London as the passenger had put their backpack behind their feet instead of the overhead lockers and they were sat next to an emergency exit. This woman shouted from the other side of the aircraft “Your bag can’t go there”, “it wasn’t there on takeoff was it so it can’t be on landing”, “it’s an emergency exit”. This crew member should’ve approached this individual on a 1-1 basis and speak to them. I had a Cold on this flight so I needed to change my masks frequently. The first time, I went to use the Bathroom to blow my nose and as my mask was soiled, I binned it and walked towards the back of the aircraft with a piece of clothing covering my mouth & nose and a staff member acted as if I had the plague. The second time I had to do the same and change my mask, I stood at the back of the aircraft whilst the crew were talking once again and I was ignored.",flew air canada vancouv london heathrow today hour layov thought would post return review get better outbound flight crew pleasant enough upon board present cabin return flight menu choic appeal hot meal provid continent breakfast make everyon laugh croissant yogurt crew member later shout passeng start approach london passeng put backpack behind feet instead overhead locker sat next emerg exit woman shout side aircraft bag go takeoff land emerg exit crew member approach individu basi speak cold flight need chang mask frequent first time went use bathroom blow nose mask soil bin walk toward back aircraft piec cloth cover mouth nose staff member act plagu second time chang mask stood back aircraft whilst crew talk ignor
"✅Trip Verified|  I don’t know what to expect from Air Canada as it was the first time flying to Canada and with Air Canada. I would guess that the crew did not want to be there but this was clear as day. The crew were pleasant enough upon welcoming but no where the standards that I am used to nor that I was expect from a long-haul airline. The Crew were quite rude when they were present in the Cabin. Crew were in the back of the aircraft chatting amongst themselves with the Curtains drawn. This was a day flight that took off a little later than scheduled, after 14:00 which added more to the confusion. Passengers were searching for Crew for Drinks and went to the back of the aircraft where they still stood talking and were asked when there would be another service. They answered “Help yourself and take some Pretzels whilst you’re there”. I was astounded at service or lack of, and expected way better.

"Not Verified|  I've been a long time user of Air Canada flight passes and up until now they have worked well for me and my family. I don't know what has changed with Air Canada but be aware they are not what they use to be. I booked my Wife with her flight pass and selected her seat. At this time the plane was just over half full. Immediately after booking her seat I tried to book my own seat with my flight passes. I got an online response back saying the plane was sold out even though I could plainly see there was over 40 seats left unsold. I called customer service only to be told my flight pass was an M class ticket and there were no M class seats available. The only reason I purchase flight passes in the first place was to be able to book my flights in the busy season knowing I could always get a seat. 80% of the time the regular economy fare is much cheaper than the cost of a single flight pass. Once again Air Canada you have taken the lead as one of the worlds worst airline for service communication and performance.

The staff didn’t really have a pleasant word for anyone. Went to the toilet in the night and it was awful, smelt and the seat was very dirty, needed checking a little more often.

✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada disappointed in so many ways. We scheduled our flight with a connection having plenty of time to make it. Leaving late from ATL still left us two hours to wait for the next flight. For some reason Air Canada rescheduled our connecting flight to one four hours later. We saw people from our flight board the connecting flight with no problem. Only on presenting our Boarding Pass did we find out we could not board. No notification from the Air Canada app. Customer Service was zero help. Supervisor tried to prevent me recording him in a Public Area and threatened to not allow me to fly out.

"✅Trip Verified|  After waiting at the gate for one hour as the plane had arrived late and had to be inspected, we finally boarded at 10pm. Once inside the plane, we were informed we had to wait due to an electrical storm. An hour later around 11pm, the plane attempted to move but had a technical issue. The staff attempted to fix it for hours but were unable to. We were informed at 2am that our flight was cancelled and we had to exit the plane and retrieve our luggages. We were also informed that there was no hotel available. As we exited the plane, we waited an extra 30 minutes to be able to reach baggage claim and leave the airport. We received zero  compensation: I had to pay for my taxi there and back the next day, accommodation and food. The plane was reschedule for the next day at 5pm (not ideal in my opinion, I asked to change but they refused). The plane was delayed because it arrived late from a prior trip: this is not an issue out of their control. The plane was delayed an extra hour due to a problem out of their control. The day-long delay was their fault: technical issue is their fault. Air Canada does not care about its customers (safety or otherwise - honestly 1 hour to check a plane in between two flights? No.). I asked to be reimbursed for the expenses, they refused. I asked to be compensated for the 1 day delay, they refused. I tried again using Air Cover, they refused.

"✅Trip Verified|  I will never fly Air Canada again. My family and I had a 10 a.m. morning flight scheduled to depart Dublin with a 5.5 hour layover in Toronto in order to make it stress-free back to Florida. For unknown reasons (not weather-related) Air Canada delayed our Dublin flight so it did not leave Dublin until about 1530 (3:30 p.m.). They did not offer any sort of compensation for meals while we were stranded in the airport waiting for information about the flight, they kept pushing back the departure time in small 1-2 hour increments. When we finally arrived in Toronto, we had to run through the airport to another section, then had multiple stops for Immigration and Customs. Air Canada did not offer assistance getting through the airport nor offer any assurance that we would make our flight home. We had no time to get a bite to eat or rest because the 5.5 hour layover I planned did not happen. The only reason we made our flight from Toronto to Orlando, was because Customs searched the plane for 60 minutes looking for drugs, according to the Air Canada Rouge pilot, since the plane just came from Montego Bay. We were the last people to board the plane, breathless of course from running through the airport. I was stressed, my children were stressed and it was a horrible day. I requested compensation for the 5-hour delayed flight from Dublin to Toronto but because it was an ""in-transit"" flight, I am not eligible for compensation - no matter that I was inconvenienced tremendously.

✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada did not help my mom that supposed to go on wheelchair when she was getting out of the plane from her flight Calgary to Vancouver. Because of this she walked long distance and got lost in the airport because she was a first time flyer. She developed edema in her legs when she got home and her legs was painful. She said she showed her boarding pass to the crews and asked but they said wheelchair wasn't noted on the boarding pass. I asked this matter to the ground crew when he hand me the boarding pass and he said its already in the system. But to the crew who don't see it in the boarding pass even if costumer ask will don't mind it. The law state that whoever identify themselves who needs wheelchair should be given.

"Not Verified|  I was disappointed by Air Canada. They don’t provide headphones (although they will sell you a set).  It was a 4.5 hour flight, but they don’t provide even the smallest snack. Worst of all, they charge $35 to check a bag in. So people don’t do that if they can take a large carry-on for the overhead locker plus a smaller one for under the seat. Consequently, on my flight they ran out of room in the overhead lockers, so had to start offering to check some bags in to the hold for free. What a ridiculous system. Most airlines encourage as much luggage as possible to be checked in which reduces the chaos in the narrow aisle when embarking and disembarking.  They encourage cabin luggage but don’t have enough capacity to handle it when the customers do exactly what the airline encouraged them to do. And they give their passengers jet lag by having the blinds down on a daytime flight - flying eastward in daylight you have to stay awake. Chatting to one of the staff he said it made it easier for the staff if the passengers sleep.",disappoint air canada provid headphon although sell set hour flight provid even smallest snack worst charg check bag peopl take larg carri overhead locker plu smaller one seat consequ flight ran room overhead locker start offer check bag hold free ridicul system airlin encourag much luggag possibl check reduc chao narrow aisl embark disembark encourag cabin luggag enough capac handl custom exactli airlin encourag give passeng jet lag blind daytim flight fli eastward daylight stay awak chat one staff said made easier staff passeng sleep
"Not Verified| Toronto to Manchester. Appalling customer service, before flight and during. They clearly treat their customers with disdain if not contempt. During the flights Manchester to Toronto (and return), the cabin staff did the bare minimum. An elderly woman had to ask three times for a glass of water. The food offerings were just about edible. No water service at all, during a long haul flight. Absolutely the worst cabin service I've ever experienced, and that includes the dire Ryanair. The flights were delayed. Indeed, all the Air Canada flights from Toronto that day were delayed. I had booked my ticket on 18th October 2021 and checked in for the flight online as soon as I was able, but I was not allocated a seat but placed on standby. Yet Air Canada was still selling economy seats on the flight after I had checked in. At the airport we were informed that the flight had been overbooked. Absolutely appalling practice. Will never fly Air Canada again and would strongly recommend others to avoid like the plague.",toronto manchest appal custom servic flight clearli treat custom disdain contempt flight manchest toronto return cabin staff bare minimum elderli woman ask three time glass water food offer edibl water servic long haul flight absolut worst cabin servic ever experienc includ dire ryanair flight delay inde air canada flight toronto day delay book ticket th octob check flight onlin soon abl alloc seat place standbi yet air canada still sell economi seat flight check airport inform flight overbook absolut appal practic never fli air canada would strongli recommend other avoid like plagu

Told there was nothing to do about it because the flight was full and we'd have to call for a refund. And we will. I'm just venting because there isn't anything any airline will ever do about this type of bad customer service. Air Canada is just another addition to a long list of airlines who don't really care about their customers. They just are collecting dollars hoping for the people who won't chase down the refunds.

Air Canada agent sent us directly to Lufthansa to arrange issuance of new boarding passes. Of course it has not been coordinated with Lufthansa so few passengers have ""travelled"" the airport here and there.

"✅Trip Verified|  This was our first trip post Covid to Germany and as it was high season, we wanted to be comfortable so we booked J-Class for our trip to and from FRA via YYZ from YOW. Our check in at YOW was seamless as well as being very professional. The Maple Leaf Lounge was well staffed, spotlessly cleaned with very fresh tasty food and drink to enjoy. Boarding was very easy via Zone-1 and we were able to get our carry on into the overhead lockers (Full flight as well) on the new Airbus-220 in which we found clean and well appointed. Service as expected on a short inter city flight was well done by very polite professional crew. On an arrival in YYZ we transited to the Air Canada Signature Lounge where we enjoyed a small hot meal with appetizer with appropriate wine and champagne. Boarding in YYZ for FRA was seamless using Zone-1 and flight left late due to the number of passengers (full flight). On board service, food and drink selection was excellent due to the type of overseas flight. On arrival in FRA, we start at the B-Concourse with a 20-minute walk through immigration to the baggage hall where our baggage (4 pieces) was coming off the belt. On our return we changed a later flight to an earlier domestic connection easily thanks to the FRA staff. The MLL in FRA was excellent well appointed with food, drink with helpful staff. Even took advantage of having a shower before departure which was very nice. The FRA YYZ flight was exceptional service as well great food and drink. Even the Captain entered the first J Cabin to talk to passengers which was a nice touch. On arrival in YYZ no issues with customs or immigration with thanks to the Arrive Canada Ap and NEXUS. Our last flight was delayed due to a weather issue from the aircraft leaving DEN for YYZ. The CCSA kept everyone informed on delays as well as my email and Ap messaging service. On arrival in YOW our baggage arrived so no issues with this flight. In conclusion Air Canada handled itself brilliantly and the number of emails as well as text messages were very reassuring that they were doing their best to keep us informed at all times.",first trip post covid germani high season want comfort book j class trip fra via yyz yow check yow seamless well profession mapl leaf loung well staf spotlessli clean fresh tasti food drink enjoy board easi via zone abl get carri overhead locker full flight well new airbu found clean well appoint servic expect short inter citi flight well done polit profession crew arriv yyz transit air canada signatur loung enjoy small hot meal appet appropri wine champagn board yyz fra seamless use zone flight left late due number passeng full flight board servic food drink select excel due type oversea flight arriv fra start b concours minut walk immigr baggag hall baggag piec come belt return chang later flight earlier domest connect easili thank fra staff mll fra excel well appoint food drink help staff even took advantag shower departur nice fra yyz flight except servic well great food drink even captain enter first j cabin talk passeng nice touch arriv yyz issu custom immigr thank arriv canada ap nexu last flight delay due weather issu aircraft leav den yyz ccsa kept everyon inform delay well email ap messag servic arriv yow baggag arriv issu flight conclus air canada handl brilliantli number email well text messag reassur best keep us inform time

"✅Trip Verified|  On 17 Jul 22, my family and I traveled under Air Canada (AC) booking # 4GN88Y to catch a flight (flight # AC8927) from Toronto (TOR) to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) leaving Toronto-Pearson IAP at 2030 hrs. We had arrived earlier in the day around 1630 to TOR on AC flight AC897 from Athens, Greece; an exhausting/grueling 10-hour flight. We had about a four-hour layover between flights. Around 2025 hrs, just before our scheduled boarding time, an AC rep, announced over the PA system there could be a delay of about a 1/2 hour - hour, as a co-pilot had not arrived for our flight. Surprisingly, around 2045 hrs, the AC rep announced we all would board the plane for PIT. All PIT passengers boarded the flight for PIT, after about 15 - 20 mins we were informed by the pilot that the co-pilot hadn't arrived, the flight was canceled, and we had to deplane & go back in the terminal and see AC personnel on the 3rd floor for assistance in rebooking our flight. My family/all of the PIT-bound passengers deplaned & went inside, where an AC rep let us know we would have to go through Customs (Again!), and try to get rebooked on another PIT flight. This would be the last information an in-person AC rep gave us at TOR IAP, and things became very disorganized. We made it through customs and went to retrieve our bags; no AC rep was there to give guidance/assistance (took over an hour!). The AC area was a catastrophe complete with crying children & stressed-out adults who didn't know what to do. When we finally got my daughter’s luggage it was badly damaged (caster wheel missing/hard case cracked); the luggage was only a few yrs old, and cost around $100. We discussed renting a car (one-way to PIT) and driving home that night, as my wife and I had work the next day, and my daughter had a law school prep class. We were exhausted & just needed to get home. While my wife & daughter, who were exhausted & frustrated waited for our baggage, I went to the 3rd floor & tried to find an in-person AC rep, but to no avail, all AC personnel appeared to be gone for the day. An airport employee directed me to a bank of phones to contact AC for rebooking & to get a voucher for a hotel if we had to stay overnight. I called from the bank of phone; got disconnected! However, a fellow passenger was able to get in touch with an AC (""Brian"", I believe), who advised he could book my family on a AC Flight from TOR to PIT the next afternoon around 1415 hrs. He also advised he couldn't help with securing a hotel, but if we could manage to get a hotel room, we could submit the expenses to AC for ""prompt"" reimbursement. I asked Brian about getting reimbursed by AC for renting a car and driving home (one-way rental to PIT); he informed AC would definitely reimburse us for this expense, as well as fuel costs for the vehicle, if we submitted receipts to the AC website. Based upon the affirmative representation from an AC rep that we would be reimbursed for renting a vehicle (& fuel for vehicle) we made the decision to rent a car, which took over an hour and cost $300; we also incurred fuel and toll charges. Arrived home about 0545 hrs, totally stressed out and sick to our stomachs. Filed a claim with AC & after now about 45 days, all we have received is an auto reply email AC rec'd our claim. No reimbursement, no phone call from AC with an update, & certainly no apology from AC! All we ask is that someone from AC have the decency to help resolve this long-overdue claim.",jul famili travel air canada ac book gn catch flight flight ac toronto tor pittsburgh intern airport pit leav toronto pearson iap hr arriv earlier day around tor ac flight ac athen greec exhaust gruel hour flight four hour layov flight around hr schedul board time ac rep announc pa system could delay hour hour co pilot arriv flight surprisingli around hr ac rep announc would board plane pit pit passeng board flight pit min inform pilot co pilot arriv flight cancel deplan go back termin see ac personnel rd floor assist rebook flight famili pit bound passeng deplan went insid ac rep let us know would go custom tri get rebook anoth pit flight would last inform person ac rep gave us tor iap thing becam disorgan made custom went retriev bag ac rep give guidanc assist took hour ac area catastroph complet cri children stress adult know final got daughter luggag badli damag caster wheel miss hard case crack luggag yr old cost around discuss rent car one way pit drive home night wife work next day daughter law school prep class exhaust need get home wife daughter exhaust frustrat wait baggag went rd floor tri find person ac rep avail ac personnel appear gone day airport employe direct bank phone contact ac rebook get voucher hotel stay overnight call bank phone got disconnect howev fellow passeng abl get touch ac brian believ advis could book famili ac flight tor pit next afternoon around hr also advis help secur hotel could manag get hotel room could submit expens ac prompt reimburs ask brian get reimburs ac rent car drive home one way rental pit inform ac would definit reimburs us expens well fuel cost vehicl submit receipt ac websit base upon affirm represent ac rep would reimburs rent vehicl fuel vehicl made decis rent car took hour cost also incur fuel toll charg arriv home hr total stress sick stomach file claim ac day receiv auto repli email ac rec claim reimburs phone call ac updat certainli apolog ac ask someon ac decenc help resolv long overdu claim

"Not Verified|  Orlando to Halifax via Montreal. We used another airline to fly from Florida to Halifax. But our Air Canada experience from Halifax, to Montreal, and then to Orlando, was handled really well. As we all know, many airlines are understaffed, flights are cancelled and flyers are left waiting at gates for hours while crew from another flight arrives. It's routine, every time I have flown in the last year. Our departing flight from Halifax was a half hour late. We received a prompt email and were reassured our connection in Montreal would be held for us and 16 other passengers. The counter check in was smooth. The clerk was polite and friendly. She told us the connecting flight would be held to accommodate us and the other passengers. When we arrived at the gate, announcements were made to reassure us that our trip would not be cancelled or further delayed. We boarded the flight when they said we would. Our arrival in Montreal was also guided. The clerks moved us to Priority security check-in, and then to a counter for entrance to Customs. So apparently, US nationals are put through customs in Montreal before we fly back to our country. That went smooth too. In addition to us, there were about 30 other passengers expedited through this staging area and onto Customs counters. A man directed all of us to the counters and assured us our flights were waiting for us. He was emotionally poised and seemed to know exactly what was going on with the flights.

"✅Trip Verified|  Worst customer service, so rude staff, to start with my flight was delayed by 1 and half hour due to technical issue but no compensation or at least good customer service should be given. As we entered no one greeted. I had already called in earlier to customer care for my 1 year old baby bassinet and the request was in place but the air hostess though had the seat too but did not provide me one. Moreover when i asked for baby food, no one turned back to me and later when i asked they said they don't have it on flight at least as an courtesy for the little one they would have told me. The worst part was as my baby pulled out the instruction guideline from the front net, the air hostess snatched from his hand so rudely and said it is not a toy.

When I did some more digging, I saw that the same flight had been cancelled almost every other day (and at least one flight each day from a different time but same route was cancelled). When we arrived in Toronto, we sat on the tarmac for an additional 90 minutes! The crew and staff could not have cared less. They were indifferent, as this seemed they were used to it.

We missed our transfer due to this, but when we asked to be rebooked and provided a hotel (due to a 23 hour layover) we were told ‘I don’t know why the pilot told you that’ and the customer service agent insisted the delay was due to the weather (despite the fact that we had already landed before the delay). No hotel was provided and the airline proceeded to not load up ur bags on our new flight meaning we arrived home with lost baggage.

"✅Trip Verified|  This my first and last time ever flying Air Canada. I had a horrible experience. My plane was scheduled to leave PDX Airport at 6:30 am on 8/25 I arrived in more than enough to to board the flight the Staff announced that the plane would be late because ""there were too many planes in the air.""  We were told that the plane would be leaving PDX Airport 45 minutes late. I was scheduled to land in Vancouver BC to connect with my flight to Puerta Vallarta to leave at 8:50 am. When I inquired if we arrived late how would that affect my flight out of Canada the flight attendant informed me that I would have 26 minutes to get to my next gate she reported it was narrow but I would make it on time. We landed in Canada we were quickly notified that there were no steps available to leave the plane and that their would be a 15 - 20 minute wait because they needed to find steps so we could deboard the plan. We waited on the tarmac for 30 minutes once the steps arrived folks was fussing, cussing, and angry that multiple patrons including me the missed their connecting flights the staff did not care they offered no support or assistance I had to walk around talking to several air Canada flight Staff members no one had answers they all acted as if they had no clue about their jobs. I asked to speak with a manager this was no help at all he was rude as well when I asked if they could assist me with finding a flight he told me there was nothing he could do. They also lost my luggage it took them hours to find it when they finally did I got no apologies.

"✅Trip Verified|  Arrived early for boarding, once we got to the front of the line, they told us we needed to check our bags in because they ran out of space in the overhead compartments. I really don't understand how you can run out of space, when you arrange for an aircraft for a certain number of people. The Air Canada rep was very cold and careless about the situation. It's one thing to have changes, but at least be friendly and show some respect to your customers. She brushed off any questions that I was about to ask, and rushed me through. Couldn't get two words in. When we boarded the plane, the seats were very dirty - crumbs, tissues, and garbage in the area of the seatbelt and around the chair. This made us feel unsafe, considering we are still in a pandemic. You say you are taking every possible precaution to maintain the cleanliness for the safety of the passengers, but clearly we are not seeing that. The menus and the safety feature pamphlet were also filthy and sticky. Very minor issue - no free snacks? come on. Another minor issue - the outlets for the headphones are for those that don't even sell anymore. Like what? After we landed, we waited almost 45 minutes to exit the plane, because they were not able to dock it in the right spot. Something was blocking? It really was not made clear to the passengers as to what was happening. It would have taken you 30 seconds or less to explain to the passengers, instead of leaving them hanging. Exit the airplane, to find out our checked luggage had not been loaded. Waited another 40-45 minutes for them to load it and collect our baggage. I will never fly with this airline again.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada is really struggling lately. They used to be my go-to despite often having some delays on their routes, but nowadays it's just completely spiraled into nonsense. Their website is often broken. They cancelled two of my flights - both citing weather reasons. Once it was actually legitimate as across the board flights got cancelled. However, for the first time they had cancelled 6h ahead of time (how could you know the flight can't take off that early?) while other flights by other airlines and a bit later in the day was still able to fly. The only redeeming quality is that now their customer service line doesn't take 4h like it used to to connect to someone. Only took me 20 minutes and the person I got actually knew what they were doing. That might be a fluke and I just got lucky though, but I will certainly not be flying Air Canada anytime soon if I can help it.",air canada realli struggl late use go despit often delay rout nowaday complet spiral nonsens websit often broken cancel two flight cite weather reason actual legitim across board flight got cancel howev first time cancel h ahead time could know flight take earli flight airlin bit later day still abl fli redeem qualiti custom servic line take h like use connect someon took minut person got actual knew might fluke got lucki though certainli fli air canada anytim soon help

There were two other direct flights to the same destination on the same day, but the customer service didn't bother to try and put me on them. I spoke with at least 8 different people on the phone, and they all told me different things. All were acting as if it were my fault that the company cancelled the flight. I went to the airport, trying to get on one of the direct flights. After waiting for 45+ minutes in line (only two registration stands were open), I finally got to speak to someone. The person was very rude and again acted as if I were to blame for the cancellation. Anyways, after multiple phone calls I got a flight on the same day. It was later in the day and not direct, so super inconvenient. Because of Air Canada I missed a very important event and wasted my time trying to get some response from them. Like I said, don't fly them - they are unreliable and their customer support is terrible (okay, just one out of 8 people was actually helpful - the one who helped me book a new flights).

"✅Trip Verified|  This is the worst trip I’ve ever experienced in my life. It started with each flight being delayed which it didn’t really affect my trip until I was coming back to Jeddah. It started when my flight got delayed in Minneapolis causing the missing of my next flight from Montreal to Cairo. I traveled with 4 kids and it was such a mess trying to catch the flight we’ve been rerouted to which is from Montreal to Athens. I asked the agent who printed our boarding passes if my luggage will be rerouted and she said yes! After a long, hard, tiring trip and a long wait in Athens, we made it Jeddah and guess what no luggage. I checked in 12 pieces of luggage none of them arrived and the worst is that Air Canada doesn’t want to file a claim for me stating they’re not the last carrier I traveled with. The other airline company doesn’t want to file a claim for me either stating that their name is not on the baggage tags. To summarize this, Air Canada is the worst airline company I’ve traveled with in term of service, food, timing, comfort and customer service.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada is terrible. I paid over $300.00 for a direct flight from Montreal to BWI. I could have purchased a ticket for $120.00 if a wanted a flight with stops. I selected the most expensive direct flight option. Thur flight got cancelled and replaced with a two flights Montreal to Toronto and Toronto to BWI. The flight from Montreal was very late. While I was in the air the second flight from Toronto to BWI got cancelled. According to the customer service no flight was available on the same day. They offered me to fly back to Montreal and from there to DC the next day. Then they instructed where to pick up my luggage. However, I couldn't find my checked in bag. I had to speak Air Canada rep and he told me that my bag got checked in for the next flight and would stay in the airport. I tried to explain that all my belongings were there but he didn't want to listen to me. I had to find an emergency accommodation and buy a few things to spend the afternoon and night in Toronto No assistance or accommodation was offered to me. Next day I flew to Montreal and I was assured that my bags were loaded on the flight. In Montreal I had to wait an hour before I was able to pass the custom office control because my luggage couldn't be found. It remained in Toronto. My flight to DC was rescheduled twice. Originally I was supposed to land around 3 PM but instead I landed after 5 PM. I still don't know where my luggage is. No compensation or even a simple apology was ever offered by Air Canada. I lost a precious vacation day because my original flight was cancelled. I had to spend extra money because my stay in Canada was extended against my will.

"✅Trip Verified|  Worst travel experience of my life. Supposed to be heading to Germany for a work convention. Flight was delayed out of Newfoundland which made us miss our connection in Toronto. So they tried to put us on a different flight with a different company but ""couldn't"" actually transfer our tickets because they used a European operator called Eurowings and we had already ""checked in"" at our original departure. So be aware if your Air Canada flight is operated by another company because they'll use that as an excuse to screw you over. If you're reading this Air Canada rep; maybe don't make deals with other companies if you can't provide customer support. So now I'm stuck in Toronto, going to be over 24 hours late arriving to a work thing and they're doing everything not to help. Sure they gave us a hotel room for the night and $20 each in food vouchers for the airport but that doesn't begin to make up for the stress of all of this. Can't even call to get compensation because you have to ""go online"" so they can proceed to ignore your claims. Terrible company with even worse customer service.

What is most disconcerting is the number of large carts of lost luggage labeled with dates going back up to a week in full public access that had not even been touched by AC staff which makes me highly doubt the AC claim that they are doing everything they can to reunite lost luggage with travelers.

We got there 5 minutes after they closed the doors, the airplane had not moved from the gate, but they would not let us on. This I accept as I’m unclear about FAA rules once an airplane door is closed. What I don’t accept is the absolute incompetence of booking us on different flights, losing our luggage, and having absolute no remorse about treating passengers like cattle.

On my flight up to Toronto some of my friends coming to the same destination had their flights canceled, others had theirs delayed by 8-10 hours it was ridiculous. Don’t have so many flights if you are so understaffed. On the way back my friends and I took a plane from Halifax to Toronto and then to Houston. The Halifax one got delayed by several hours but thankfully we were able to get on an earlier one. About an hour before the flight to Houston it got canceled and then we had to book a flight for the next day. Except on my booking it said I was rebooked for a different flight the same day and didn’t have to wait. Unfortunately after waiting 4 hours they basically said “Sorry you just got tot fly tomorrow”.

"Not Verified|  Flew Air Canada overnight from Montreal to Heathrow. The flight back, despite the seat being rather comfortable with thanks to the extra legroom seat. The cabin crew were rather rude.

They gave me a cup of water and when I asked for a second cup, the purser told me that I was only allowed one. My food was nothing short of dreadful and came in tiny portions on plastic trays with stale bread buns. For breakfast, all that was offered was a small yogurt pot and an Air Canada special - a croissant. On the outbound flight to Canada, I flew with WestJet and they offered 2 Complimentary beverages and snack services in addition to one hot meal service on nearly a 7 hour flight and the cabin crew went out of their way to help from bringing me hand sanitizer to showing me how to work the entertainment system. At the start of the return flight, I asked for some eyeshades to sleep with to which they shrugged their shoulders and declared that they 'do not have any'. They didn't offer any snacks during the flight. On a positive note though, when I asked one flight attendent in the galley for food, they offered me a meal from the dinner service that was leftover. However, on the whole, I wouldn't fly with Air Canada on the basis that the flying experience was significantly worse than that of the vast majority of others airlines which I have flown.",flew air canada overnight montreal heathrow flight back despit seat rather comfort thank extra legroom seat cabin crew rather rude ask bottl water told abl offer cup water bottl leftov gave cup water ask second cup purser told allow one food noth short dread came tini portion plastic tray stale bread bun breakfast offer small yogurt pot air canada special croissant outbound flight canada flew westjet offer complimentari beverag snack servic addit one hot meal servic nearli hour flight cabin crew went way help bring hand sanit show work entertain system start return flight ask eyeshad sleep shrug shoulder declar offer snack flight posit note though ask one flight attend galley food offer meal dinner servic leftov howev whole fli air canada basi fli experi significantli wors vast major other airlin flown

"✅Trip Verified|  The employees at Heathrow were wonderful and helpful. Our flight from London to Montreal was mostly uneventful except for the flight attendant yelling at people for not wearing their masks. We were instructed like children to wait until the entire row was served and the attendants had proceeded to the next row before removing masks. There were no friendly attendants. Most looked like passengers were bothering them, and they wished they were somewhere else. The flight from Montreal to Newark was horrible. This airline knows exactly how many passengers are scheduled to arrive and depart probably down to the minute, yet for multiple flights connecting through Montreal there were only 3 customs agents. The delay was nerve racking, but we were able to make it to our gate in time except, our flight was delayed. Four times. Our entire time waiting at the gate, we never saw one employee of Air Canada. We would receive a text message or email telling us our flight was delayed for 45 minutes. 30 minutes after that, we'd get another delay message. No plane was present at the gate during any of these delay messages, so I knew it was going to be much longer than 45 minutes. After 3 hours and 40 minutes of delays, several of the passengers waiting hailed an Air Canada employee briskly walking by our gate hoping to be unnoticed (she was looking at the closed bistro across from us). She did promise to get a manager. About 30 minutes later, someone shows up. She never announces anything, never talks to anyone, never asks if anyone needs assistance. My son, who has a seizure disorder, needed sleep but there were no accommodations for him and we had no idea how long the delay would ultimately be. The only restaurant in the terminal had an hour and 45-minute wait and were out of most things on the menu. There were two kiosks for fast food and drinks. Both of them were out of food and closing 20 minutes after we arrived. Finally, the gate agent that shows up starts calling zones to board. Never asks if anyone needs help, never smiled once, never even looked people in the eye. She typed fast and furious and just watched people scan their tickets to board. The attendants on the flight were the same as the previous flight. No one smiled, no one was helpful or even remotely friendly. At least they were consistent. If I have to fly out of my way next time or pay more to not fly Air Canada, I will. Traveling Is hard and expensive enough these days. I'm going to fly with an airline whose employees can at least pretend their grateful for the passengers that ultimately pay their salary. I gave them a 2 rating because we made it safely to our destination. Which is probably the only positive thing I can say about this experience.",employe heathrow wonder help flight london montreal mostli unev except flight attend yell peopl wear mask instruct like children wait entir row serv attend proceed next row remov mask friendli attend look like passeng bother wish somewher els flight montreal newark horribl airlin know exactli mani passeng schedul arriv depart probabl minut yet multipl flight connect montreal custom agent delay nerv rack abl make gate time except flight delay four time entir time wait gate never saw one employe air canada would receiv text messag email tell us flight delay minut minut get anoth delay messag plane present gate delay messag knew go much longer minut hour minut delay sever passeng wait hail air canada employe briskli walk gate hope unnot look close bistro across us promis get manag minut later someon show never announc anyth never talk anyon never ask anyon need assist son seizur disord need sleep accommod idea long delay would ultim restaur termin hour minut wait thing menu two kiosk fast food drink food close minut arriv final gate agent show start call zone board never ask anyon need help never smile never even look peopl eye type fast furiou watch peopl scan ticket board attend flight previou flight one smile one help even remot friendli least consist fli way next time pay fli air canada travel hard expens enough day go fli airlin whose employe least pretend grate passeng ultim pay salari gave rate made safe destin probabl posit thing say experi

"✅Trip Verified|  Recently flew from Halifax to Vancouver in economy class. I booked comfort fare so I was eligible for preferred seating. I was also given the option at the time of booking to purchase a Chef Jerome meal box for $14.95. The two options looked really good so I made the purchase. Check-in was smooth, and boarding was just about on time. Seat was 20D in an exit row and offered excellent legroom, During the first (and as it turned out, only) service I was asked if I wanted to purchase anything. I said I had pre-purchased a meal and the Flight Attendant said that they weren't given a list so asked to see my boarding pass. After digging it out I showed my boarding pass which had 'meal' listed on it and she then asked what I wanted. I said I ordered the Chef Jerome meal box and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said I could select one meal and a snack so I ended up getting a cheese/fruit tray and some nuts. This was very disappointing as I was looking forward to the meal box I purchased. Furthermore, there was only 1 beverage service on this 6 1/2 transcontinental flight, which is absolutely unacceptable. There were also no Care Kits handed out like there were on my inbound flight, although perhaps these have now been discontinued. The aircraft was clean and new, although the bathrooms were not kept very clean throughout the flight. I did have a very positive interaction with one of the FAs as I was leaving the lavatory area. She asked how my flight was going, made some friendly small talk, and asked if she could get be anything which I appreciated. It was almost like she felt bad that only one service was provided. Landed on time and my checked bag arrived in a reasonable amount of time despite the airport being very busy.",recent flew halifax vancouv economi class book comfort fare elig prefer seat also given option time book purchas chef jerom meal box two option look realli good made purchas check smooth board time seat exit row offer excel legroom first turn servic ask want purchas anyth said pre purchas meal flight attend said given list ask see board pass dig show board pass meal list ask want said order chef jerom meal box idea talk said could select one meal snack end get chees fruit tray nut disappoint look forward meal box purchas furthermor beverag servic transcontinent flight absolut unaccept also care kit hand like inbound flight although perhap discontinu aircraft clean new although bathroom kept clean throughout flight posit interact one fa leav lavatori area ask flight go made friendli small talk ask could get anyth appreci almost like felt bad one servic provid land time check bag arriv reason amount time despit airport busi
"✅Trip Verified|  Used Aeroplan points to upgrade to business class for my outbound flight to Halifax. Non-business class passengers were using the priority check-in so I had to wait about 10 mins for check-in. Although priority security screening was apparently included, I was sent through the regular security line which was fine as it wasn't busy. Headed to Maple Leaf lounge, which was quite crowded. The buffet consisted of a few salads, two soups (one labeled as cream of mushroom but was clearly cream of broccoli), and a limited selection of light snacks. Wine, beer and soft drinks also offered. It was only after I noticed someone getting delivered a hot dish that you could order 2 different meals from your table. I ordered the flat bread pizza, which was ok. The other option was a vegetarian curry, I headed to the gate early but as I arrived I received a notification from AC that the gate changed so I went to the new gate. Boarding was delayed just over an hour as inbound aircraft came from the US and was at the US gates so they had to wait for it to be towed to our gate. Boarding was chaotic as ever but since I was in zone 1 I got to board right away. I was not greeted by name. I took my seat (4D, aisle seat in the last row of business class). A couple asked me to switch to 4B so they could sit together. Since it was the same seat just on the opposite side of the aisle I obliged (I like aisle seats). FAs handed out Air Canada's Care Kits before departure and they took orders for dinner. The options were a chicken dish with a rice/quinoa mix, or a vegetarian gnocchi. Pillows and blankets were handed out but they were just the cheap ones used in international economy. Cheap earbuds were also offered. The seat was clean but not at all comfortable. I booked business so I would have a more comfortable 6 hour journey overnight but I found it very uncomfortable. While the legroom was good, the entertainment box impeded my legroom. My preferred seat in economy on my return flight (separate review) was actually more spacious. Dinner was served shortly after takeoff. Since it was close to midnight at this point I really wasn't in the mood to eat but I went for the chicken dish, which was small and quite bland. Surprisingly that was the only service offered on the 6 hour flight. While I wasn't expecting another meal I did fully expect a beverage service before arrival. I am sure I could have asked for a coffee but was surprised we weren't offered another drink. They did pass out some snacks from a basket before arrival but it was mostly chips and chocolate bars, not something I wanted at that hour. The business class washroom on B737MAX aircraft are notoriously small, and Air Canada's is no different. It was kept quite clean. The Flight Attendants were efficient but not overly friendly. My checked bag arrived at the carousel in a timely fashion. Overall I was disappointed with this flight. North American business class with Air Canada is nothing special and the seat was very uncomfortable. The meal was small (which was ok as I wasn't hungry) and quite tasteless. A comfier pillow and blanket would have been appreciated for this overnight flight rather than using the same cheap ones used in international economy. North American business class with Air Canada is not worth the extra cost in my opinion. Stick to economy and splurge on a preferred seat.",use aeroplan point upgrad busi class outbound flight halifax non busi class passeng use prioriti check wait min check although prioriti secur screen appar includ sent regular secur line fine busi head mapl leaf loung quit crowd buffet consist salad two soup one label cream mushroom clearli cream broccoli limit select light snack wine beer soft drink also offer notic someon get deliv hot dish could order differ meal tabl order flat bread pizza ok option vegetarian curri head gate earli arriv receiv notif ac gate chang went new gate board delay hour inbound aircraft came us us gate wait tow gate board chaotic ever sinc zone got board right away greet name took seat aisl seat last row busi class coupl ask switch b could sit togeth sinc seat opposit side aisl oblig like aisl seat fa hand air canada care kit departur took order dinner option chicken dish rice quinoa mix vegetarian gnocchi pillow blanket hand cheap one use intern economi cheap earbud also offer seat clean comfort book busi would comfort hour journey overnight found uncomfort legroom good entertain box imped legroom prefer seat economi return flight separ review actual spaciou dinner serv shortli takeoff sinc close midnight point realli mood eat went chicken dish small quit bland surprisingli servic offer hour flight expect anoth meal fulli expect beverag servic arriv sure could ask coffe surpris offer anoth drink pass snack basket arriv mostli chip chocol bar someth want hour busi class washroom b max aircraft notori small air canada differ kept quit clean flight attend effici overli friendli check bag arriv carousel time fashion overal disappoint flight north american busi class air canada noth special seat uncomfort meal small ok hungri quit tasteless comfier pillow blanket would appreci overnight flight rather use cheap one use intern economi north american busi class air canada worth extra cost opinion stick economi splurg prefer seat

On the flight from Delhi to Montreal, there was an old Indian lady sitting behind our seat. She either had hearing issues or she did not speak English. So the flight attendant had to repeat something twice before she could understand/respond. The flight attendant sounded so mean and disrespectful. On another occasion, flight attendant when requested by my daughter to replace the headphones, was rude to respond.  While we were boarding from SFO to Delhi the other day (June 19th), the check-in lady would not accept the digital copy of my covid-19 tests. She wanted me to print them. I almost missed my flight as I had to run places to get the prints.  Overall food was good. Entertainment was lacking.

"✅Trip Verified|  This is my first time flying Air Canada and it will be my last. My husband and I volunteered to check our luggage on the flight from Cleveland to Athens. We were told our luggage would be waiting for us when we landed. It was not. We had to go to the baggage carousel and wait almost an hour for our carry on and then go through customs and security. Members of our flight felt lied to and were very upset as we were. We were the two middle seats in the middle of the plane. There was absolutely no room and it was absolutely miserable. I almost had a panic attack about five hours in. My entertainment system did not work from the time we took off, and despite telling three flight attendants, no one cared to help me and in fact insinuated I was the one who broke it. We landed in Athens and my husband’s checked bag did not make it on the flight. It took two and a half hours to get through the line. It took him two days to get the bags back. On the way from Athens to Toronto, I tried to upgrade our seats to no avail. We were in zone 4. By the time we got on the plane, there was no overhead space left and we were told we had to check the bags. We had an hour and a half layover in Toronto and did not have time to go through customs again. I started crying and only then one flight attendant helped us put our bags in the closet up front.

"✅Trip Verified| Lisbon to Raleigh via Montreal. On August 2, 2022 I flew business class on a ticket purchased from Air Canada beginning in Funchal, Portugal with Star Alliance partner TAP. The second flight (which was on Air Canada) was delayed more than 90 minutes leaving Lisbon due to a ""catering issue."" During the Lisbon - Montreal flight I was told by flight attendants that a gate agent would meet the flight on arrival in Montreal to help with connections which turned out not to be the case. There were no employees anywhere around where we exited nor any monitors on connecting information as all arriving international passengers had to go through immigration even before going to their connecting gate. Air Canada sent me a text since I had missed my connection in Montreal notifying me that it had automatically booked me on two new flights to replace my prior non-stop flight. There were no new boarding passes tied to the text and so I went to the Air Canada customer service desk on arrival to get my new boarding passes. The employee there said I would need to go to baggage claim and speak to a representative there first to get my bag and then I would need to recheck it on the 2 new flights. I then ran the gauntlet trying to get through passport control, Covid protocols for Canada, customs, etc only to wait in a long line in baggage claim. When I finally got to the front the agent looked up my claim ticket and said my bag should be automatically moved to the 2 new flights which was great to hear (but did not actually happen). This incredibly frustrating and time-consuming process in the Montreal airport could have been avoided if the original customer service agent had given me accurate information. By following the Air Canada customer service agents instructions I had to exit the secure area which meant technically entering Canada. This led to having to go through security (and twice disposing of liquids bought post-security at the prior airport) and their lines two more times (both in Montreal and in Toronto) as well as Canadian customs and Covid queues that I should never have had to deal with as a transiting passenger. My Montreal to Toronto flight was uneventful but then my Toronto - Raleigh flight was delayed more than 2 hrs due to supposed baggage system failure at the Toronto airport. (The Air Canada Toronto to RDU flight earlier in the day had been cancelled after passengers had boarded and sat on the plane for an hour! They then waited 6 hrs and were rebooked on my flight only to be delayed another 2 hrs) I arrived at RDU 7 1/2 hrs after my original ticketed time to find my luggage had not automatically been transferred to my new flights as the baggage agent in Montreal had claimed. With my checked bag not arriving, this required waiting in another line at RDU along with 6 other passengers whose bags also did not arrive. The baggage agent at RDU had no pre-printed forms to fill out but rather hand-wrote the information needed on blank 8 1/2 x 11 pieces of paper where we then filled in the fields needed.

On the journey to return, Air Canada had a lot of weather problems. Our flight got canceled. The next day we ended up going on Montreal to Doha to Kolkata on Qatar business as a result. On the return, we flew Air Canada from Delhi to Montreal. Having flown Qatar business on the way over, the contrast was very clear. The lie flat beds were nice, but the air Canada attendants were pretty lackadaisical about their service. It was as if they did not care much about why they were there, just perfunctory about their service. The joy of flying wasn't there. The food was reasonable but the service just made it an average trip. Furthermore, when I arrived in Montreal, Air Canada has changed my connecting flight airplane type. Instead of a business class in a jet flight, I was changed to a propeller plane, all economy. I did not receive any compensation for this.

Over the past month , i read about horror stories with Air Canada and poor staff performance. I was really scared. I had a 1:37 mins layover at Toronto, while going to Delhi. The flight from Calgary to Toronto was on time (july 22). Perfect. I got my connection to Delhi. The flight was delayed by 40 mins or so. But that did not matter. We still reached Delhi appx 30 mins ahead of scheduled landing time. On the way back from Delhi July 28th, I had my parents accompanying me. The flights were all on time. The staff in Montreal was spot on. I was impressed. Very pleasant. Very polite and efficient. But my flights both ways were appx 24 hours long and Air Canada would get a 5 star from me.

"✅Trip Verified|  I have never been treated so badly than flying with this airline.  There were three nice employees of air Canada our entire trip. However the miscommunication that occurs within air Canada is horrifying. We had to go through US customs in Toronto so we had to wait for our bags to be cleared. We were told “do not come speak to an agent unless you missed your flight or your flight was canceled” so we didn’t. And we waited for 4 hours until we finally missed our flight and still hadn’t been passed through. When we went to reschedule our flights there wasn’t a straight through so we had to make another stop and not even fly out of Toronto until the next morning. Spending the night in the airport is never fun but they made us go to the E gates and the next morning we were told “there will be someone working in customer service to escort you back up to the F gates at 4 in the morning.” Well guess what, nobody was there! Waited an hour and nobody came but luckily there were many other people waiting to get escorted also and security finally let us go through to the F gates. They also lost our bags so all that waiting for them to get checked in Dublin just so they could lose them. They delayed our flight again so now we will probably miss our next connecting flight that we wouldn’t have had if they had their act together in the first place. Air Canada turned what was supposed to be a great end of our honeymoon (18 hours of travel) into a nightmare of 36 hours of stress and exhaustion. Shout out to the few kind employees that didn’t treat us like idiots, prisoners, and overall disrespect.",never treat badli fli airlin three nice employe air canada entir trip howev miscommun occur within air canada horrifi go us custom toronto wait bag clear told come speak agent unless miss flight flight cancel wait hour final miss flight still pass went reschedul flight straight make anoth stop even fli toronto next morn spend night airport never fun made us go e gate next morn told someon work custom servic escort back f gate morn well guess nobodi wait hour nobodi came luckili mani peopl wait get escort also secur final let us go f gate also lost bag wait get check dublin could lose delay flight probabl miss next connect flight act togeth first place air canada turn suppos great end honeymoon hour travel nightmar hour stress exhaust shout kind employe treat us like idiot prison overal disrespect

"✅Trip Verified| Montreal to Philadelphia. Air Canada was the worst, they kept delaying our flight till finally they said due to shortage of staff, all flights are canceled, I had a flight from Montreal to Philadelphia, not to mention flights to Philadelphia have been canceled for several days (my point is they knew, they would cancel this flight too but wouldn’t want to initiate sooner), they didn’t help passengers in any way, some people were going back and forth for 4 days, the employee at the gate reassured us that AC will refund for the flight they didn’t operate! I also had to pay extra for the luggage they didn’t deliver to the destination! I had to be in Philly and since I saw all of those passengers from previous canceled flights, I chose to rent a car and drive to Philly, car rentals charged me $480 US dollars for 24 hour, and I had to drive about 8 hours, I came to Philly, contacted them for flight and luggage refund and compensation, and they replied to me after about two weeks to tell me that it was due to pandemic and they can not refund anything, so basically they rip off the passengers, charge them for the flight THEY DIDNT OPERATE AND the baggage THEY DIDNT DELIVER! I forgot to mention that all suitcases were at the airport unsupervised, anybody could take any suitcase and there was at least 200 unclaimed suitcases there I decided to call them and I was on the line for about 3 hours and they told me that they can issue a refund and it should go through another airline!

"Not Verified|  We arrived at the airport to find that the flight from Manchester was put back from 12.15 to 12.30 then to 13.15 with no explanation. When we finally started to board everything came to a stand still as there were apparently 19 passengers who had got on with boarding cards that didn't have a seat as the aircraft. We were told that the aircraft on the stand was different to the one that we were checked onto and had a different seating configuration but no-one had told the check in staff! We eventually left at 14.30 which made us very anxious about missing our connection in Toronto. We needn't have worried as the 18.55 Toronto to Vancouver flight was delayed and then cancelled. We don't have a mobile 'phone so couldn't get text or e-mails and were told very curtly by the only AC staff we could find to go to the customer service desk but when we got there the queue went into infinity and didn't move. Fortunately the people in front of us were also going to Vancouver and kindly relayed the messages that they were getting as there were no PA announcements. Not very helpful to those with no 'phones! Another flight was eventually found and was supposed to leave at 21.15 but that was delayed 3 times and eventually left at 23.30 which meant we got to Vancouver at 01.25, five and three quarter hours late. The return flight from Calgary via Toronto was not much better and got us back to Manchester only four and a half hours late. There was one AC lady in Calgary who was wonderful and helped us with our boarding card and took the checked in bag for us as we couldn't drop it off because we were outside the four hour bag drop time because they changed the flight time and we didn't know. Once on board two of the overhead lockers wouldn't shut so a mechanic had to be sent for twice, the seating was very uncomfortable, the international leg food inedible, the domestic food had to be paid for, my husbands seat back entertainment didn't work and the staff were rude and unhelpful.

"Not Verified|  Flew 4 Air Canada flights in 2 weeks, each time they disregarded the own carry on limits and allowed what I would deem as full suitcases on board, each flight I was told there was no room for my carry on in the overhead lockers and I would need to jam it under my seat, even though I'm clearly 6ft 3. When I flew back to Melbourne they knowingly sold me a connecting flight with not enough time to self transfer at Sydney airport. 3k for flights and I had to self transfer in 2 hrs, take a train between terminals at Sydney airport, requiring clearing customs and negotiating a 3 hr domestic check in line.

"✅Trip Verified|  The latest trend from air Canada after several flights between march and July, is to split travellers in a single booking. Always putting us only 1 or 2 rows apart in an attempt to force us to pay for seats together. And apparently all seats other than ours are ""preferred"" and come at a cost.

After flying the most uncomfortable and inhumane seats on the planet, by adding way too many seats than this plane could fit to make more money. This airline has done a great job at failing amazingly. Service is just horrible, never been treated worse. Was tapped on the shoulder by a flight attendant quite aggressively and shortly after, was asked a question with an arrogant tone and loud volume. If it says there is WiFi, there really isn’t.

They put us on another flight to LaGuardia New York 2 hours later which was even further delayed by 3 hours. The connections hall in Toronto was a total mess. People were standing in line which was barely moving and agents just kept getting up and walking out without any disregard for passengers. On top of everything when we got to LaGuardia it turned out they've lost our luggage. When we filed claim we found out luggage was simply not put on our flight.

Ended up in a hotel at 4 am, now hoping I will be able to fly out today. Will be flying to a different airport than originally planned but I have a job so can’t just wait three days to come home.

"✅Trip Verified|  My flight from Toronto to Atlanta was cancelled. After already flying from Asia to Toronto, this was the last leg of my journey home. The flight was cancelled without an announcement at the gate; the flight was simply removed from the departures board. I received a text notification of the cancellation about 2 hours after it was cancelled. At this point, I also received an email with a rebooked flight with a connection for the following day where I would arrive in Atlanta in early afternoon. Since I had to work that day, this was insufficient for my travel needs. There was no agent at the gate to help with rebooking. The wait for customer service was over an hour as stated on the customer service line when I called. Thus, while staying on line with customer service, I was told I needed to go through Canadian customs as I could not stay in the gate area overnight. I went to the Air Canada customer service desk and waited in line for about an hour. At this point, an Air Canada employee walked around handing out customer service business cards and stated that the customer service desk was closing for the day. No one ever answered the customer service line. I had to book a flight on Delta for first thing the next morning to get me to work on time. Once home, I submitted an online customer service request for reimbursement. It has been 26 days and I have yet to receive a reply. Today, I called the customer service phone number provided, which went to reservations. I was told there was no one in customer service I could speak with. I was also told that because I booked my ticket through priceline, all reimbursement requests would need to go through priceline. However, priceline had already told me to deal directly with Air Canada for reimbursement.

"✅Trip Verified|  Our itinerary was a very poor experience for us. We dealt, almost exclusively, with rude staff. And when it wasn't being directed at us, it was toward other passengers. We encountered rolling delays, for which we were given bizarre explanations. For example, we were told that embarkation was awaiting the plane to ""cool down"" because it was ""a little warm"". This delay was allegedly ten minutes, though would actually be thirty. All this was after three initial delays (each 45-60 minutes). Once on the plane, it would be almost another hour before wheels up. Overall, a very unpleasant experience which caused an almost 30 hour delay in our travel plans.

"✅Trip Verified|  This flight was the final leg of our journey from Rome to Honolulu via Munich and Vancouver. All of our flights were delayed, we flew Lufthansa from FCO to MUC, then MUC to YVR. Our final leg from YVR to HNL was with Air Canada. Our flight from MUC to YVR was delayed leaving MUC, and landing at YVR. Going through customs and immigration at YVR was long and frustrating. Looking at the Departure screen our flight AC 519 to HNL was in the final boarding process. I asked the AC agent on duty at the passenger screening what could be done to insure my wife and I didn't miss our flights. She escorted to the head of the line. After going through security, it was then through passport control, then customs, very time consuming due to the large amount of people. By the time we cleared customs, there was an Air Canada agent with a cart to take us to our gate. What a very nice touch. We arrived at gate E80, we were the last people to board, even on the screen our names were displayed for last call. We were able to board the plane thanks to the assistance of the ground and cabin staff.

"✅Trip Verified|  The worst airline that exists, the crew was rude to me, the food is average. If you call customer service they tell you that the waiting time is 2 hours.  I flew Miami Montreal Athens, what a nightmare, the first delayed flight, I was able to make the connection because all their flights are delayed. Back I had a layover of 3 hours and I spent all of them making lines in the corridors of the airport trying to check point for American citizens, something incredible. On my last flight Montreal Miami I had upgraded my seat to one in aisle since I had come from a 10 hour flight and I wanted to be more comfortable and when I finally got to the counter they changed my seat to one in the middle and told me that they would make me a refund. It was not about the refund but that I had paid and chosen a seat and they changed me without any explanation. Extremely rude plane crew, really do yourself a big favor and avoid this airline.",worst airlin exist crew rude food averag call custom servic tell wait time hour flew miami montreal athen nightmar first delay flight abl make connect flight delay back layov hour spent make line corridor airport tri check point american citizen someth incred last flight montreal miami upgrad seat one aisl sinc come hour flight want comfort final got counter chang seat one middl told would make refund refund paid chosen seat chang without explan extrem rude plane crew realli big favor avoid airlin
"✅Trip Verified|  We were flying from Toronto to Seattle with stopover in Vancouver on July 1, 2022. Flight AC103. Our flights was supposed to leave at 8:15. At approx. 7 am we received a sms that our flight was delayed until 10 am. Since we had to embark on Alaskan cruise on July 2nd I went to the Customer service and asked them if they could bump us to an earlier flight so we won't miss our connecting flight in Vancouver. She said no because we had checked luggage. We've waited and at 9 am we've got another text message that our flight won't leave until 1 pm. We waited again and at need we got a message that our flight is cancelled.  When approached the Customer service I was told the they have no idea when and how Air Canada will send us to Vancouver. When I pointed out that we have a cruise coming next day and we must be in Seattle by the end of the day July 1st they said that it cannot be guaranteed. I went to Air Canada website and found a direct flight Toronto-Seattle leaving at 7pm. I brought this information to them and asked us to bump us (there were free seats) to this flight. They said no because there were only seats in business class available. We couldn't understand why we cannot be upgraded for free to the business class if Air Canada cancelled our flight. Long story short we were told that if we want to be on the flight AC543 Toronto-Seattle we need to buy  tickets to business class! Since we couldn't miss our cruise we did that paying about CAD5,300. We went upstairs to Air Canada Counter and asked to redirect our luggage to Seattle with our new flight AC543. We did this twice with two Air Canada employees and they both reassured us the we are going to get our baggage (with all our clothes for cruise - active, dressy, casual, toiletries etc.) When we got to Seattle no need to say our bag was lost. Today's in July 12 and it's still sitting in Seattle (we got a call this morning).

"✅Trip Verified|  I will never fly Air Canada again. I had a horrible experience on the second leg of my flight -- Toronto to London, Ontario on 6/20/22. I received text messages every 20-30 minutes indicating the flight was delayed, only to have them send a text hours later that the flight was cancelled - at about 11:20 p.m. This was followed by another text indicating I was rebooked on another flight on the 23rd. I could have walked to my final destination in less time. Myself and other passengers were left stranded in the airport with no help. After much wandering, I finally found an Air Canada employee who was unable to help, but directed me to another area, where there was no one to help. I eventually made my own plans to get to my destination. To add insult to injury, today, Air Canada informed me I would not be reimbursed for my cancelled flight because it was due to weather. At no point in the many texts I received or announcements that were made was weather mentioned. Days before my return flight, scheduled for 6/30/22, I received notification that my flight from London to Toronto, Ontario was cancelled, and had to make arrangements to get to Toronto to catch my flight home. I suppose they'll find a way to blame something not covered for that cancellation as well, despite the fact that I incurred additional charges in order to get it. The indifference shown to paying passengers is unforgivable. They literally just stole our money, inconvenienced us, and are responsible for additional expenditures since they left the entire flight stranded.",never fli air canada horribl experi second leg flight toronto london ontario receiv text messag everi minut indic flight delay send text hour later flight cancel p follow anoth text indic rebook anoth flight rd could walk final destin less time passeng left strand airport help much wander final found air canada employe unabl help direct anoth area one help eventu made plan get destin add insult injuri today air canada inform would reimburs cancel flight due weather point mani text receiv announc made weather mention day return flight schedul receiv notif flight london toronto ontario cancel make arrang get toronto catch flight home suppos find way blame someth cover cancel well despit fact incur addit charg order get indiffer shown pay passeng unforgiv liter stole money inconvenienc us respons addit expenditur sinc left entir flight strand
"Not Verified| Manchester to Calgary via Toronto. I am writing this review on behalf of my elderly parents. The entire experience from Air Canada has been horrible. My Father had all ETA visas needed, confirmed online by CIC and because of a glitch in (I assume) Air Canada software was unable to board the flight. My mother had to board by herself. Delays at all ends both times. First delay caused the missed connection at Toronto. No hotel was offered, 33 hour journey, had to sleep on floor of airport. My father was rebooked and was refused 2nd leg of transfer in Belgium. Leaving him stranded overnight. Eventually got back home to UK next day totally exhausted and literally near collapse. No explanation can be given as to why he was (a) refused to board in the UK and (b) was allowed to fly via Air Canada from Man. and subsequently denied boarding on the 2nd flight to Toronto. All flights were operated by Air Canada. Tried to call Air Canada help desk and was on hold for 4 hours, yep that's right, 4 hours! Phone eventually stopped playing music and went to dead tone. As I write this I am just hoping that the flight from YYC to Toronto isn't delayed for longer than the 45 mins stated. If it is then the whole ordeal will start again. My advice, if you have no other option but to use Air Canada, get to the airport the day before. The only word I can use to describe the whole experience would be ""ordeal"". Covid may have started this but greed has been the driving force behind this terrible experience. I am not going to rest until I have every penny of compensation legally allowed. Needless to say the next time we spend thousands of dollars on air travel we not be using Air Canada. I simply think they are incompetent.

We tried to call Air Canada to get this resolved, but guess what, they don't actually have a customer service at all apparently. The reps at the airport are contracted and really have no sway over their system at all. Air Canada to this day has still not worked with us or helped us get to our destination.

"✅Trip Verified|  The experience for my wife and I was bad; the kiosks were non functional, not easy to follow (bad user experience design), check-in staff were very sub-par and lacked the emotional intelligence to respond accordingly with non working kiosks, even with the queue elongating. They also would not assign me and my wife next to each other with regards to seats on the plane. What kind of airline lacks the awareness of assigning seats to people when a ticket for a couple or family is bought together. And then at the gate, it’s the same for the staff. The whole crew is so underwhelming and the experience is just overall negative. It’s really sad that common customer service experience cannot be provided.

"✅Trip Verified|  I would like to make a complaint. It's funny how things are! When Air Canada sends us an email from the CEO explaining that we may be facing some delays or even cancellations of some flights, and this email is an early apology, and in this same email they ask us to be understanding. However, when the situation is the opposite, that for some reason we cannot travel on the scheduled date and we call to try to reschedule the flight, Air Canada imposes absurd fees for changing the flight. My wife had surgery on June 24th, at first it was supposed to be a simple surgery and the next day she could leave the hospital. However, after the surgery, my wife had complications and almost lost her life, having to spend 5 days in the ICU, having to receive a blood transfusion, losing more than 7 kg. But luckily the worst is over and now she is recovering at home. We have all the information about the surgery and what happened, and a letter from the doctor asking my wife to postpone her return to Canada. She was supposed to return now on June 24th, the doctor requested something around 30 more days for her to fully recover. Based on this, I called Air Canada's medical office to request a change to her flight, and I was informed that this situation was not a medical situation and that they cannot change the ticket. That I should contact the call center, normally as if it were a normal situation. So, I called and talked to an attendant, he said that I should pay a difference of 800 dollars if I wanted to change the ticket for the given date. My wife's ticket has 3 destinations, Foz do Iguacu to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Toronto, and Toronto to Ottawa. I asked if it would be possible to change all these trips to just one direct trip from Sao Paulo to Montreal, but I was informed that the fee to make this change would be 1800 dollars.",would like make complaint funni thing air canada send us email ceo explain may face delay even cancel flight email earli apolog email ask us understand howev situat opposit reason cannot travel schedul date call tri reschedul flight air canada impos absurd fee chang flight wife surgeri june th first suppos simpl surgeri next day could leav hospit howev surgeri wife complic almost lost life spend day icu receiv blood transfus lose kg luckili worst recov home inform surgeri happen letter doctor ask wife postpon return canada suppos return june th doctor request someth around day fulli recov base call air canada medic offic request chang flight inform situat medic situat cannot chang ticket contact call center normal normal situat call talk attend said pay differ dollar want chang ticket given date wife ticket destin foz iguacu sao paulo sao paulo toronto toronto ottawa ask would possibl chang trip one direct trip sao paulo montreal inform fee make chang would dollar

"Not Verified|  I don't suggest you fly with this company. The reasons I'm rating with 1 star are the following. I had a flight from Greece to Montréal and then I had to change flights to grab another one from Montréal to Los Angeles the same day just one hour away from the arriving time of the first flight. When we landed in Montréal they told us that our next flight got cancelled and that you have to re do the whole procedure from the start. After waiting in lines for 2 hours (after a 10 hour long flight) an Air Canada staff member comes to the line to tell us that we will not be able to catch a flight on this day and that we should book a hotel. She told us all the hotels are booked here so ""go figure it out"". As you can imagine this caused a lot of anger as it was unacceptable. Oh! They said the reason our flight got cancelled was due to ""lack of staff due to covid"". I guess hiring extra hands in times of need are too much of a cost for a small company like Air Canada. Anyway after 100 passengers waiting in line to book their already paid for flight complained she went on to talk with an Air Canada manager. When she returned she told us that we will wait in line to rebook our flight as we were already doing and that we are going to go to a hotel for the night (she then proceeded to give us a list of hotels). She told us to keep the receipt and that Air Canada will refund you for your stay there. ""You just need to call this number"". (She gave us a number to call). I paid 250$ for a night at a hotel. Traffic was so high due to cancelled flights that you couldn't get a room easily. I was tired and frustrated so I got this hotel. Long story short I've been calling for the past 3 days to get my refund and Air Canada puts me on hold with an estimated waiting time of 3 hours. I called reservations (they were the only ones that picked up) to tell them what's happening. They said ""Yeah you have to wait 3 hours but then you will definitely get service"". I told them there's no way that's ok to say! I asked for an email that I can contact for possibly skipping the phone call and they told me ""No you have to wait on your phone call"".

"Not Verified| Tel Aviv to Chicago via Toronto. We were flying from Tel Aviv to Toronto and that flight went smoothly. When we landed, my mom got a notification that our connecting flight from Toronto to Chicago was canceled. Now, this is common, but the next flight we were booked for was for the next morning, and it didn't even go to Chicago. It set us up so we go from Toronto to New York and to Chicago. We went to the luggage pick-up place and found 1/3 luggage. We rented a car and drove home to Chicago. Now, do note that that entire time we were going from one line to another over the span of many hours. That was a week ago, we still don't have our luggage, and the tracking thing shows that they still haven't been found. We heard that thousands of lost luggage are getting accumulated at the airport with no practical way of digging them out. We assume that our luggage is most likely at O'Hare. Most of my clothing is in there, and we have several valuables there too. This is the story for many others.

"Not Verified|  Their website doesn't work, neither does their app, Air Canada's website is atrocious. You often try to buy a ticket, only for the booking to fail right at the point of purchase. The app is also prone to failure when buying a ticket. The custom support waits are terrible (50 minutes on hold, and they'll hang up on you). Other things that suck: try adding a credit card from the mobile app if you live in Washington, DC. Sorry, there's no ""District of Columbia"" state or ""Washington DC"" state that you can choose. You're just stuck if you're trying to use the mobile app. Sometimes you're told that the purchase didn't go through, only to find out that you did buy tickets. Better double-check under your bookings on the website, except that webpage often fails to load too. I couldn't find a way to use airline vouchers to pay for flights in the mobile app. You'll have vouchers because when you issue a refund - sometimes you don't get a refund on your credit card. Instead you get groups of $2000 vouchers. The rules for vouchers are also esoteric. Those are the things that suck from my most recent interactions with Air Canada.

We were then abandoned in the airport told to see area after area until morning came 14hrs later and management arrived. Finally got re-booked and then booked the airport hotel which I was told I am ""owed"" which was a $500 nap that I haven't been reimbursed for. My bags in the ""Standby holding"" were also lost, I couldn't immediately retrieve them. How is that even possible?

The flight from Venice to Toronto is 10 hours, and many screens (including mine) were not working. When I tried to politely ask for information, the flight attendant was extremely rude.

"✅Trip Verified|  Have had a totally horrible experience with Air Canada. They cancelled a flight on us due to mechanical issues and did not send notification of rebooking. Rebooked us for the next day but we couldn't get a in touch with anyone from reservations or support to see if there were other options as we had the flexibility to try another airport in the area. No one at the airport could help and they directed us to phones that supposedly went to their reservations support team. The phones said someone would answer quickly, but there were people there who had been on hold for more than an hour. After waiting on hold for over an hour, we gave up and went with the rebooking. Additionally, since the cancellation was due to a mechanical issue, we asked for a hotel voucher. They said they would not give it to us. We had traveled one way to Alaska for a cruise and this was the end of the cruise in Vancouver and we were trying to get home. They viewed this as we were ""originating"" our trip in Vancouver and therefore would only give us a voucher for a taxi to take us home and bring us back for the flight. Totally ridiculous. Then gave us a card to contact customer relations to get a reimbursed for the hotel and meal. Tried calling the phone number and it is not in service.",total horribl experi air canada cancel flight us due mechan issu send notif rebook rebook us next day get touch anyon reserv support see option flexibl tri anoth airport area one airport could help direct us phone supposedli went reserv support team phone said someon would answer quickli peopl hold hour wait hold hour gave went rebook addit sinc cancel due mechan issu ask hotel voucher said would give us travel one way alaska cruis end cruis vancouv tri get home view origin trip vancouv therefor would give us voucher taxi take us home bring us back flight total ridicul gave us card contact custom relat get reimburs hotel meal tri call phone number servic

When I woke up the day of traveling, I get a whole email completely changing it all. I arrived in Montreal and instead of going straight to my destination with a 1 hour wait, they made a 16 hour wait. We had to pay for a hotel, which by the way was expensive. And instead of going straight to my destination, they put us in Houston for 1 hour. The service is also terrible. On a a regular plane, the snacks cost money and they are very  rude about serving drinks. An international plane is nothing better. The food is terrible and on top of that they lost our baggage!

"Not Verified|  Absolutely do not recommend Air Canada. Months ago we booked at flight home from Geneva to LA and while the first leg (Geneva to Montreal) went fine, once we landed we were told that our Montreal to LA flight was cancelled and they had booked us on a flight the next day. Unfortunately we had additional flights and events planned from LA so started looking at other options to get us back sooner. There was an overnight Montreal to Calgary and then a Calgary to LA flight (with a 4 hour layover in between) so we took it, but the Montreal flight was delayed by almost 5 hours so we missed our Calgary connection. Next they sent us Calgary to Vancouver with a Vancouver to LA connection - both flights were delayed but we finally made it home 20 hours after our initial arrival time and without the premium economy upgrades we paid for. Unfortunately our luggage is MIA and we can't get a hold of anyone to help - lines are too busy to even accept your call or let you leave a message. We repeatedly asked the Air Canada luggage agent at LAX about our bags and he simply handed a paper with call information and had I not been too tired (40+ hours of travel at that point) I would have noticed and insisted that he needed to give us a file tracing number and never even mentioned it or offered. He absolutely needs to be fired for his complete disinterest and failure to do even the basics of his job. While a number of the ticketing agents we spoke to tried their best to help, we saw a number of reps who were downright rude or like the baggage agent were completely disinterested and incompetent in their job.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada has serious issues at high levels. (Pun intended!) Starting at LAX they had limited staff who were not trained. All four of our flights during the two week trip were delayed. We spent one and a half hours sitting on the airplane on the runway/tarmac waiting for a parking place to de-plane, which resulted in numerous missed connections by members of our group. There was utter confusion at every AC kiosk. In Toronto, Air Canada had approximately 75% of flights canceled (in good weather). You could literally be looking at the electronic blue flight status screens and see your flight change from ""On-time"" to ""Canceled"" while you watched. So many flights were canceled, changed, and re-routed, they even lost pilot's luggage! Three times my daughter's connecting flights were canceled. They finally sent her to a rental car to drive four hours home after an 11.5 hour flight. Their car rental affiliate then charged $700/day to get a car, and she was told it would be months before she gets a refund from AC. Customer Service cannot be reached by phone, only by email. Proper management and organization at the top, along with employee training, would prevent this domino effect their errors are causing. I will never fly Air Canada again, ever!

✅Trip Verified| Stay away from this airline - if you can. It’s terrible. The check-in crew don’t seem to know what they are doing. My bag was delayed on arrival. Air Canada baggage service couldn’t trace it - even with baggage tags issued by their system. Then I had to deal with their off-shore call centre. I called several times. They will keep you on hold for well over an hour on average (and at times will drop your call after the long wait). The nightmare begins when you go through and speak to their representatives. The reps are low-energy and lackadaisical. They don’t seem to care about their client’s issues. They still have not found my bag. Don’t let this happen to you.

"Not Verified|  My Greece family vacation started out on June 13 leaving Miami International Airport arriving into Montreal for connection to Athens . I decided to carry 3 of our 4 bags on. The trip went without a flaw. After 12 days in Greece it was time to head back home to Miami. When we board our return flight from Athens to Toronto with a connection to Miami I decided to check all 4 piece of our luggage. Flight boarded on time and was suppose to leave at 1:15-1:30. Wasn’t cleared to take off until 3pm. At that point I realized we were not making our connecting flight to Miami. After arriving in Toronto the disaster began with this airline. We missed our connection as I expected. When asked for assistance on rebooking was told by multiple Air Canada employees to use the “White Phones” located at gate #15. Upon arriving to gate 15 and waiting in line for over an hour I discovered most (50%) of the phone were not in working order. When I finally got my opportunity to use a working white phone I was on hold for over 2 hours. I had enough and hung up. I then proceeded to Gate 4 international re-bookings where I again waited for over two hours with hundreds of other people to be told they are closing the gate at 12 midnight and will reopen at 4 am. I was then handed a card and told to call this number to rebook your flight. They offered no  hotel vouchers, no food vouchers, no  beverage vouchers. Employees said to find the nearest hotels.  We decided to find the best location to sleep for the night. I figured I would give the phone number in the card a try -after 3 hours and 7 minutes of being on hold I had enough.  I had to book another flight to Montreal to connect to Miami. Instead of arriving in Miami on June 23 (original return flight) we arrive on June 25. I forgot to mention my luggage was lost. They assured me it was on my flight before I boarded to travel to Montreal.

At least that is what I thought. after I arrived in Frankfurt I waited for over 2 hours for my baggage but nothing arrived. I submitted the report for lost baggage and I need my baggage very quick. Sadly the customer support is very bad. I don't get any answers per email and since I am now in Germany the customer support with the international number does not feel responsible for my problems. They say the only place where I can get help is the Air Canada baggage office but they just have a North American number which I cant call for free. I don't want to pay for this airline another cent. I called the international hotline and asked for a check in fees refund but they claimed that its not possible even though their own websites says otherwise. They just don't want to pay for my delayed baggage and lie for that.

"✅Trip Verified|  I have been without luggage for 17 days, I left for Athens on 14th and came back on 23rd and spent hours on hold with Air Canada for the call to most of the time be dropped after 1 hour waiting or to be transferred to a call center where all you hear is “I completely understand your frustration”. I have done everything requested, submitted receipts, checked web tracer twice daily, reached out on twitter facebook Instagram and even linkedin with ZERO reply. My bag was “never scanned in” so I do not know how they will find it. They kept saying “it is not lost”…well I consider it lost if it does not arrive to my destination nor 17 days after the initial departure. They also do not deem the bag lost for 20-30 days so I have to wait to file a claim with my travel insurance until they indeed confirm it lost. Today I called again and there is now a recorded that says they have too much volume to even place you on hold, ever heard of a call back number?

There are no words to describe how bad their customer service is. Lazy, indifferent employees at all levels. I could write a small book about all the problems me and my family faced. Due to delays and cancelled flights, the total time for the 15 hour trip was 48 hours. They have a customer service number for customers to call. When you call you are usually on hold for 2 hours and then the call is often dropped so you have to call back hold for an additional 2 hours. Once you eventually get through, you get no help.

To verify our part in this story we arrived at Heathrow without our eta as we were in transit only and did not realise it was a requirement. Entry to Canada visa's. We made a mistake but boy did Air Canada do everything possible to compound the issue with their arrogance and incompetence. This could have been sorted out in no more than 15 minutes if their team had been organised and trained correctly. Instead we paid £1,500.00 to book alternative flights, taxi's, overnight accommodation, arrived a day late to our destination and had more stress than with any other airline in all our cumulative flying time. This company is rotten to the core! To add insult to injury, to resolve the issues we experienced, they said they would give us 25% off our next flight with them. Why would they believe that following our worst flight experience ever we would come back for more. There's an absolute arrogance within this company. I received their offer on the 06 May 2022, my wife was absolutely disgusted and upset.

"✅Trip Verified|  Started off with them bumping me out of the premium seats I had booked, was irritating but shrugged it off. Then, due to airspace constraints around Toronto, the flight left an hour late. Then, once we landed, we had to wait 45 minutes to park at the gate. I had to go through a gauntlet of locked doors (where we had to wait for an agent to come and unlock/open), two sets of these actually. Then had to fumble through Canadian passport control (even though was just a connection) and ultimately missed the connecting flight to Barcelona. Then, had to go to customer service and wait in line for 45 minutes because they only had one agent working (they eventually increased this 30 minutes into being in line, which helped). They then booked me on a flight through Frankfurt that left about four hours or so later (was supposed to leave Toronto direct to Barcelona at 7PM but ended up leaving for Frankfurt at 11:30PM. Then the flight out of Frankfurt to Barcelona (Lufthansa luckily) was delayed a couple of hours but ultimately arrived in Barcelona at 6:45PM when I was supposed to arrive at 10AM so ended up there 8 hours or so late. Because of the missed connection, my bag didn’t make it to Barcelona so had to wait three days for them to get that over to me. There were no apologies (other than the automated letter they sent after I lodged a complaint) and then to add insult to injury, on my flight back, they bumped me out of premium again so at that point, being nervous about further delays I booked another flight back home with Delta, which turned out to be a good move because on the return trip (which was through Montreal), they cancelled the final leg of my flight back to Detroit so I would have been stuck in Montreal. I would definitely not recommend Air Canada to anyone, even though all the other airlines are struggling as well, it just seems that Air Canada is struggling the most.",start bump premium seat book irrit shrug due airspac constraint around toronto flight left hour late land wait minut park gate go gauntlet lock door wait agent come unlock open two set actual fumbl canadian passport control even though connect ultim miss connect flight barcelona go custom servic wait line minut one agent work eventu increas minut line help book flight frankfurt left four hour later suppos leav toronto direct barcelona pm end leav frankfurt pm flight frankfurt barcelona lufthansa luckili delay coupl hour ultim arriv barcelona pm suppos arriv end hour late miss connect bag make barcelona wait three day get apolog autom letter sent lodg complaint add insult injuri flight back bump premium point nervou delay book anoth flight back home delta turn good move return trip montreal cancel final leg flight back detroit would stuck montreal would definit recommend air canada anyon even though airlin struggl well seem air canada struggl
"✅Trip Verified| Washington to Seoul via Toronto. 1. My parents were supposed to fly from Washington to Toronto to Seoul on 5/22/22 and booked their tickets through Air Canada (AC8681, AC061). Air Canada switched their flight from 1 layover to 2 layovers without any reasonable compensation, Washington to Pittsburgh to Toronto to Seoul. On the day of travel, they were notified of the Pittsburgh-Toronto flight cancellation AFTER they arrived at the gate in Washington. Their baggage had already been checked in and sent off to Pittsburgh, even though the flight staff knew of the cancellation in Pittsburgh. Air Canada gave ZERO update on whether or not the baggage arrived in Pittsburgh or were put on a return flight to Washington. Air Canada's phone support was only an automated system and no human picked up the phone. After many attempts to reach the airline, my parents began DRIVING to Pittsburgh from Washington on Monday, 5/23/22, when Air Canada told them to go pick up baggage in Washington, 1 hour after they started their trip to Pittsburgh. They had to reschedule their flight to 5/25/22 and cut down their trip in Korea by 3 days. Again, no compensation was provided from Air Canada. 2. My parents got on their return flight on 6/28/22 from Seoul to Toronto and they were supposed to arrive home same day in Washington. Upon arrival in Toronto, they were told that the flight from Toronto to Washington had been cancelled and that there were no flights available for the next two days. They have been stuck at the airport for 2 hours now trying to get assistance. They are offering hotel assistance of $300/night with hotels just around the airport when there are less than 10 available rooms around the airport when there is a giant group of passengers stuck at the airport because they are unable to return home to the US. They also provided only $10 for food and drinks until their rescheduled flight. What in the actual hell can they get with $10? 3. Air Canada agents had claimed that the baggage would be transferred by Air Canada to their rescheduled flight. However, my parents arrived in Washington today (6/29), only to discover that their baggage did not arrive with them. We don't know if the baggage is still sitting in Toronto or if they are lost. They just took a taxi home without their baggage and both my parents had 2 bags each with a lot of stuff brought back from Seoul. All Air Canada so far has offered is 20% discount for my parents' next flight with Air Canada.

"Not Verified| Ottawa to Frankfurt via Montreal. Worst airline I've flown in my life. What happened: 1. There was a mother with a small child, the child was thirsty and the air hostess refused her water, she drank secretly herself. Me and one other person were yelled at by a staff member because we started eating too early. I've flown a lot in my life, I'm really not a person who is exhausting and wouldn't write the review if I hadn't been personally attacked. It's a shame that the cartels and the mafia are so strong in Canada, poor country. I am happy that I will never book this airline again. I can only advise the Canadian people to fight back. | Die schlimmste airline mit der ich in meinem Leben geflogen bin. Was ist passiert : 1.

"✅Trip Verified|Seattle to Athens via Toronto. There was only one Air Canada employee who took the time to actually assist us. Aside from that, we had the worst experience recently. It is too much to write here, but basically everyone from the flight attendants to the agents at the airports all acted as if they were being inconvenienced when asked a question. The agents at the airport would literally just walk away from customers mid question, the flight attendants sat at the back of the plane 95% of the flight and told us “if we want something we can help ourselves to it in the back.” Then, after a delayed flight that resulted in us missing our connecting flight, every agent we tried to speak to regarding direction and assistance would just say “I don’t know, you’ll have to figure it out” then walk away. Even when we returned for our flight the next day - same experience regarding customer service. I walked up to a desk where 4 employees were just standing around and one was texting on his phone. I asked him a question and he looked up from his phone with annoyance beyond measure and then gave me a snarky response that was also not informative or helpful. Our overall experience was awful UNTIL we spoke with the staff who answered our simple questions and pointed us in the right direction!

I have flown with Air Canada now 5 times this year and every single time the flight was delayed, there was no apology any of the times. This time particularly I had checked in early and picked a seat I knew I would be comfortable in as a tall person, last minute the gave me a new ticket and shoved me at the very end of the aircraft in the middle row with no explanation or apology.

"✅Trip Verified|  I arrived in Athens after my flight that departed from Montreal to find that my one checked bag had been 'delayed'. I was sent over to the baggage supervisor who gave me a baggage code for online tracking, they took down my temporary address in Mykonos and said it should take 2-3 days for my luggage to arrive and be sent to me, and that I could check the WorldTracer site for updates or call their baggage center number. 4 days later I still don't have my baggage, and neither myself nor any of my friends or family are able to access the WorldTracer website without it completely crashing, and when we call their baggage center phone number, an automated message says that Air Canada is ""sorry"" that they ""cannot put any calls on hold at the moment due to the high volume of calls"". No callback option was offered, it only said to try calling later. I tried talking to their online chat service, and I don't know if the whole thing is a bot or what, but long story short all it did was tell me to use the services that I'd tried, or to try sending a message to AC via Twitter of all things. I've been calling AC hourly for a week now and still haven't spoken to a real person. My baggage has medication in it that I have had to try and replace in Greece at my own cost, not to mention all my clothes and other important personal items. Air Canada couldn't seem to care less.

"✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline experience to date. My flight was canceled from Montreal to Pittsburgh. Air Canada rerouted us to Toronto where my group of 32 got stranded. There was no possible way for us to get back home to WV, USA. No busses, no rentals (when there were rentals they were $600+), and hardly any hotels. They offered no help and seemed annoyed by our frustration and concern. So, we sat in the baggage claim for 20+ hours until a couple of family members were able to drive 7 hours to get us. On top of that, some luggage was lost and damaged on the flight to Dublin, Ireland through Air Canada. Overall the worst customer service and attitude I have seen in an airline, and I will never fly through them again.

"✅Trip Verified| Toronto to London via Montreal. Flight was absolutely great - no complaints at all. Arrived at Heathrow T2 early morning of 16 June. Waited a long time for bags to be delivered. After additional one hour wait my bag was missing. Waited another hour in queue for the AC baggage handling service Global Baggage Solutions. Finally met someone - 'Yes, your bag arrived on the flight and it is tracked as being misdirected to Terminal 1 (which is incidentally closed). Was advised to wait at airport and return in the afternoon, when it will have been brought across. 7 hours later (multiple Costa coffees) I went back in airside to be told that it had not been delivered yet. Was told to complete an online GBS World Tracer misdirected baggage form. Twelve days later, following multiple emails and over three hours in the queue (calling North American from the UAE), didn't manage to get to speak to anyone nor receive a reply from Air Canada. My bag contains business clothes which I have managed to make do without up to now in the misguided belief that the bag would be back to me quickly. Will have to spend significantly and claim against AC which is a shame but its clear where the responsibility lays. In fact, just one email during the last 12 days from AC to say, 'we are on it, would have gone a very long way but sadly non-communication is the business model.

"Not Verified|  Air Canada will not answer the phone. Not for customer service nor for lost baggage updates. And it is byzantine/impossible to pursue much of anything online. Yes, my 12 hour itinerary from Lisbon to Pittsburgh became a 49 hour nightmare. No, there was little to no help on the ground at Toronto or Montreal. Yes, my bag is still lost a week later. No, there is not a way to get an update about this situation. They are impossible to work with and it seems to be a take it or leave it attitude.

✅Trip Verified|  Started my journey from Bangalore on june 25 IST and was suppose to reach Dallas on June 25 CST 9.30pm via Montreal. We missed our connecting flight because of long queue of luggage security check. No support from ground staff. Had to spend 5 hrs in queue to find the information of dropped Luggage. And then had to spend 13 hrs in another queue to re- book for another flight. Got some relief when got another ticket Montreal-Toronto-Dallas. Today on Jun 27 reached Toronto and to our surprise we find the flight from Toronto to Dallas is Cancelled without notification. And now again we have to go through same hassle of collecting luggage and rebooking flight. Pathetic organization.

"Not Verified| London to Kelowna via Vancouver. Why or why do we do it? Obviously being English we don't want to make a fuss! Used this airline now several times every year, we have family in Canada and obviously it makes sense - never again, The cabin staff were rude, made us feel like 2nd class citizens, this is a common issue, their fake smiles and sniggers about passengers goes on all the time. The food is so dull and boring, its their standard, the inflight films are old and nothing new or to-date. That being said the more senior the staff the less they care. I am one of so many who have expressed an opinion, when I previously emailed and complained only to receive a standard reply something a 5 year-old could put together. The 4/10 reviews say it all.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada as an organization is simply ambivalent and arrogant. I’ve flown with them twice in the last month and have experienced massive delays (in excess of 4 hours each time) without so much as one apology, let alone complimentary food or beverage once you eventually get on the flight.

✅Trip Verified|  This airline is the biggest joke. Most recently I travelled from Sault Ste. Marie to Edmonton and we had the absolute worst experience. They let us board the plane in Toronto with no food or water on the flight. It was a +40 Celsius day and we were trapped on the plane for over 3 hours in the heat while we waited for them to deliver food. About an hour into waiting they said it was going to be at least another hour and half delay and stated they would bring their manager to see if we could de-board the plane. We heard nothing else about this and we were trapped on they plane for another 2 hours. They eventually brought us lukewarm water (one cup each) and a granola bar that wouldn’t feed a small child. Finally we were able to take off and by the time they brought back the food cart they were completely out of food… so much for that 3 hour wait. We were starving and had absolutely nothing on our 4 hour flight (not even pretzels). The economy class is so uncomfortable and packed together you’re basically on top of each other.

"✅Trip Verified|  My whole 20 days trip became miserable. The flight from Detroit was delayed more than an hour due to selling extra tickets. Due to the delay we missed our flight from Montréal to Frankfurt. Even though the plane was still there they did not open the gate for us and said boarding is over. Then they rebooked us on a flight which depart after 28 hours. I have a two years old daughter and nine years old son, and a wife. we lived these hours like we are homeless. After that our flight was on AC866 which departs from Montreal to London. After we entered the plane, something was wrong with the aircraft which made them cancel the flight and made us leave the plane after 5 hours waiting with no luck we left to the counter waiting to be rebooked. I called air Canada customer service and stayed with them around 4 hours on the phone to be rebooked. When they answered i requested to cancel my whole trip and go back to Detroit. they said next flight to Detroit is after 36 hours which is insane. They also offered next flight to Beirut through Greece after 15 hours. At that time it was around 4 am and we requested hotel since we have been at the airport for around 48 hours and all hotels were fully booked. So we spent another 15 hours. On June 16th after more than 72 hours we arrived to Beirut and waited 3 hours to get our bags but no luck our luggage were not found. i went and filled a claim at the baggage center. i have been waiting since 10 days ago and until now no luck. they lost my luggage.

"✅Trip Verified|  They are incompetent and unorganized. Flights were delayed, causing us to miss connecting flights. The waiting to get through security and customs was ridiculous. We missed one of our connecting flights because our first flight was delayed 3 hours, not sure why originally, then it was delayed longer because a toilet on the plain was leaking. When we finally landed at our connection it took 60 minutes to get through customs and security. We missed our connection flight. Then they sent us to 3 different Air Canada customer service kiosks, which got us nowhere. They made us eventually go back through customs and security and gave us a card with a few numbers and said “good luck.” We waited on hold for over 2 hours before we finally got through and someone found us a flight, that was of course, delayed. However it was a good thing cuz it took so long to get through security and customs.

"Not Verified|  We were scheduled to fly from Athens to Toronto to Vancouver. I checked us in the night before, but woke up in the morning to an email that our flight was changed to a flight via Montreal 2 hours later than our original. We decided to go to the airport at our original time and inquire. The AC rep in Athens was very polite and helpful, although she didn't understand the change, as there was a good chance we would not make our connecting flight. As we waited at the airport, I received another email that our flight was again changed to the next day via Munich on Lufthansa. (We fly on points, so can fly on any Star Alliance flight). We found this very odd as we were already at the airport and had our boarding passes. We met another family that had the same issue. (I believe it was a computer glitch). We took our chances and went to the gate at boarding time. Yes it beeped red when they scanned our passes, but the girl was able to reissue the tickets within a couple minutes. We successfully boarded. Our flight was delayed in leaving by an hour. No fault of Air Canada, there was a lot of air congestion in Athens. We finally got in the air. We have flown quite a few different airlines in business class. The staff were friendly, food was good. Not sure why they charge for wifi in business class. Every other airline we have flown it's been included. The lavatories could be kept cleaner. We were about an hour out of Montreal when the captain announced that we were in a holding pattern because of heavy congestion at the airport. When we finally landed, we were kept on the tarmac for close to an hour as our gate was occupied. Again, the captain gave us regular updates. We missed our connecting flight, as I'm sure half of our flight did. We have spent the night in the airport, as there were no hotels available in the area. We have a 7:25 am flight.

Not Verified|  The worst most disorganized airline I have flown in 15 years. Currently stranded in Montreal while trying to get home from Dublin. Flight from Dublin was delayed by more than an hour. The staff at Montreal made people miss flights by stopping us from getting to the gate till our checked bags were green as scanned. They falsely told everyone that they will call out for any people whose flights are about to leave and they won’t miss their connection. Even with an hour to spare when we reached Montreal their silly rules made us miss our connection. Then we had to wait 2 hours in line to talk to an agent who rebooked us on a flight to nearby airport 2 days later. Went from agent to agent after that trying to be let out from the terminal to baggage claim. There they said our bags were coming on a belt. We got two and waited for an hour for third one to show up. Kept being told at baggage counter 3 rd bag was also there and coming and finally a third time an agent tells us the bag is in Baltimore already. Cannot reach any one at customer service number.

"✅Trip Verified|  Most unreliable and incompetent organization I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Round trip flights to Ireland and all four were hours late. All had planes in place but no pilot or no cleaning staff. The morning flight from Dublin to Montreal ended in chaos with half of the passengers missing connecting flights. Yes post Covid travel is different but I’ve never seen or experienced this level of complete organizational failure. We were sent to three different lines by three different employees trying to get to our rescheduled flight after spending hundreds on an unexpected hotel in Toronto for the evening but no need to rush, it’s currently an hour late as well.

"Not Verified|  Check in queue at Montreal was long and taking a ridiculous amount of time, mainly due to the amount of luggage each person was checking in. When we got to speak with a checkin agent (the only remotely helpful person we met from Air Canada) he advised the flight was 20 minutes late but that he’d checked and we were fine for our connection and we headed to departures 20 Minutes turned into a 2 hour delay which would have meant us missing the flight to Manchester, though we had the pilot and cabin crew for that flight on our flight from Montreal, so the next flight would be delayed too & we had a chance of making connection. On landing in Toronto I received a text advising that my booking had been changed and I was now booked on the Toronto to Manchester flight the following evening - no other info. We made a dash to the gate our original flight was leaving from, with our original boarding cards to see if we could get on the flight - we were denied boarding as they had already given our seats to someone else (not acceptable) When we asked what our next steps were as we would now be in Toronto for at least 24 hours more we were told to find a customer service agent as theY were the only ones who could help, then ignored when asking where we would find one. We had to brave arrival border checks with the ridiculous machines they have in Toronto, then explain the story to the Border Guard to be let through to departures again, where the queue was to see the “customer service” agent. The queue was not moving very quickly and at around 23.15 one of the agents announced that they finished work at midnight and not everyone would be dealt with - as the issues are purely the fault of a disorganised & inept airline I find this attitude totally wrong, and feel there should be someone there to deal with issues at whatever time is needed, especially as they also do not answer the phone. We did manage to speak with an agent who printed new boarding cards for us (no apology) and told us that we were entitled to a hotel but they did not have any available so suggested we book and pay for one ourselves and try to claim it back. I refused to do this and stood my ground, advising I did not have the money to pay for a hotel/the taxis to and from it so they would need to find a hotel for me - amazingly enough a hotel became available after about 15 minutes, along with $20 each for food for the next 24 hours. Before leaving I checked where my luggage was as we had not seen it since checking in, I was told it was tagged to travel with us the following day. We headed to the hotel with nothing in the way of toiletries/change of clothes or anything as we do not carry hand luggage to ease the traumas at security We returned to the airport the following day, Toronto Airport was chaos, with too many flights leaving at similar times, all delayed, and not enough seats so many people just sat on the floor. Eventually we boarded the flight 25 hours later than we should have done, we’re met with miserable staff, the seat back entertainment didn’t work properly which is an issue on a 7 hour flight, the food on board was lousy, and I ended up just eating the bread roll. Arriving into Manchester we had to wait to disembark as the air bridge could not be attached immediately (airports fault not Air Canada) We then had to wait for 2&half hours before we were told that our luggage had not made it and to fill in a report, and hopefully it would be delivered to us",check queue montreal long take ridicul amount time mainli due amount luggag person check got speak checkin agent remot help person met air canada advis flight minut late check fine connect head departur minut turn hour delay would meant us miss flight manchest though pilot cabin crew flight flight montreal next flight would delay chanc make connect land toronto receiv text advis book chang book toronto manchest flight follow even info made dash gate origin flight leav origin board card see could get flight deni board alreadi given seat someon els accept ask next step would toronto least hour told find custom servic agent one could help ignor ask would find one brave arriv border check ridicul machin toronto explain stori border guard let departur queue see custom servic agent queue move quickli around one agent announc finish work midnight everyon would dealt issu pure fault disorganis inept airlin find attitud total wrong feel someon deal issu whatev time need especi also answer phone manag speak agent print new board card us apolog told us entitl hotel avail suggest book pay one tri claim back refus stood ground advis money pay hotel taxi would need find hotel amazingli enough hotel becam avail minut along food next hour leav check luggag seen sinc check told tag travel us follow day head hotel noth way toiletri chang cloth anyth carri hand luggag eas trauma secur return airport follow day toronto airport chao mani flight leav similar time delay enough seat mani peopl sat floor eventu board flight hour later done met miser staff seat back entertain work properli issu hour flight food board lousi end eat bread roll arriv manchest wait disembark air bridg could attach immedi airport fault air canada wait half hour told luggag made fill report hope would deliv us
"Not Verified| London to San Jose via Montreal. Absolutely the worst airline I've ever flown. 1. MOST of their staff literally don't care. 2. The gate agents (at YUL at least) are disorganized, badly trained, ill disciplined and poorly equipped. My experience: LHR to SJO via YUL - 100 minute layover - told by ticket clerk it was plenty. No chance. Flight 70 mins late leaving London ""because COVID"" so while in the air they deplaned me from my flight to SJO (because I had a bag checked) and put me on a plane to LAX (6hours) with a connection to SJO (another 6 hours) and another 90 minute connection. The connecting agent didn't know this though - and neither did I till I read my sms's two days later when I got home. Instead she tried to get me on standby on the flight I was going to get, I got on - but then they pulled me off the plane - I didn't notice but they'd given me someone else's boarding pass who arrived after me. He looked very pleased to be getting on the plane, they didn't explain to me that they'd messed up giving me his boarding pass and I hadn't noticed till someone pointed it out later. So the gate agent said ""go to customer service"" and there isn't any in YUL departures so I had to find a gate agent. Anyway, I was now stuck in departures like Tom Hanks in the terminal with no plane and no reason to be there so I can't exit - I then spent two hours begging AC people to help me and they kept sending me to other people, eventually I found a lady who was eventually sympathetic but initially thought I'd stolen someone's boarding pass. So now we spend another 30 mins roaming the gates trying to find one without a plane so they can let me through to arrivals and I can try again with the rebooking agent. ""Oh hi! sorry you didn't make it - let me see what I can do"". Well what they could do was - book me on a flight to YYV the following morning, then on to SJO that night, ok can I have a hotel? Yes sure. Wait two hours, checking every 15 mins - then, oh sorry we've run out of hotels, you can pay and claim it. Bye. Don't forget to get your bags for extra convenience. Welcome to Canada. I head down to arrivals, clear customs, absolute chaos, thousands of bags by the carousels and a 100 meter queue for the sole baggage clerk (who incidentally was awesome if utterly overworked). Got to the front of the queue ""go to 8A, it'll be there in a minute"", two more hours waiting. Book a hotel - for the wrong night in exhausted state - non refundable of course. Curses. Book another hotel and get a cab into the city, room next to a wedding party, three hours sleep, back to the airport. Get to departures, use kiosk - doesn't print a bag tag, automatic bag machines all broken. Head to the bus class check in, to meet a queue of 50 people with one person on the desk dealing with someone with 20 bags and a desire for a different massive, comfy seat to the one he's been assigned.

"✅Trip Verified|  We flew Air Canada from Houston to Montreal and then to Casablanca Morocco and return flight from Casablanca Morocco to Montreal and then to Houston TX. All four flights where delayed leaving, the reason for leaving late was there are waiting for more passengers, each time we waited 1 hour to a 1:30 minutes, but as we waited, no one else boarded the plane, and then they said we are ready to depart, even after they close the main door, we still just sit there for another 30 minutes. This happened on each flight. The crew is so rude, and they don't give any real reason for the delay. I told the one flight attendant that we are going to miss our connecting flight and she said hopefully your flight will be delayed, no help at all. We did miss our connecting flight, I called Air Canada the next day after we finally got home, and they said it’s not their fault for missing our flight and that we have to contact United for any help.

"Not Verified|  No idea how this is the flagship airline of our country. It seems impossible for this airline to run on schedule, and to communicate properly with its passengers. Both my flights in and out of New York were delayed multiple hours, with updates drip-fed every so often which basically meant I wasted hours standing around by the gate rather than being able to rest or relax at an airport lounge or restaurant. This is nothing new, more than half of the flights I’ve had to take to and from Montreal have delays for one reason or another.",idea flagship airlin countri seem imposs airlin run schedul commun properli passeng flight new york delay multipl hour updat drip fed everi often basic meant wast hour stand around gate rather abl rest relax airport loung restaur noth new half flight take montreal delay one reason anoth
"✅Trip Verified|  The airport in Toronto was complete anarchy with hundreds of people with cancelled/missed flights. I waited over an hour in customer service line and eventually found out they are unable to book me on a new flight or get me a hotel because everything is full because too many people have missed/cancelled flights to be able to accommodate everyone. The lady at the customer service desk I was talking to got into a fight with her boss in front of me complaining about how terrible management is. I was told to book my own hotel and I could get my checked bag downstairs. (Shortly after I left they just closed down that customer service desk leaving the hundreds of people behind me with missed flights not knowing what to do with themselves). When I went to get my bag, I waited in line another hour just to find out they're refusing to give anyone their bags, because there's no way they can go back into storage and find 500 different people's bags. I was told to take my baggage claim ticket and submit a claim to arrange for my bag to be delivered to my apartment in Dallas, my final destination. I did that, and they put in the claim my address and that Dallas is my final destination. I booked a separate flight home on American, then the following Thursday I get a voicemail saying my bag is at the Dallas airport and they need to know whether they should mail it to me or if I want to pick it up. The callback number in the voicemail wasn't working for me, so after work I drove to the airport to get my bag, then was told the sent it back to Toronto because they didn't hear from me. Apparently they didn't know Dallas was my final destination, even though it was clearly in the claim, so they have to send it back to where the claim originated, and they made that decision to send it back in less than half a day, giving me very little time to respond. I shouldn't have even had to respond to anything at all, when I submit the claim in Toronto I was told it would just be Fedex'ed to my apartment in Dallas and that was it. Now I need to wait for it to circle all the way back to Dallas again.  I can't wait to get my bag back so this can all be over and I can never fly with Air Canada again.",airport toronto complet anarchi hundr peopl cancel miss flight wait hour custom servic line eventu found unabl book new flight get hotel everyth full mani peopl miss cancel flight abl accommod everyon ladi custom servic desk talk got fight boss front complain terribl manag told book hotel could get check bag downstair shortli left close custom servic desk leav hundr peopl behind miss flight know went get bag wait line anoth hour find refus give anyon bag way go back storag find differ peopl bag told take baggag claim ticket submit claim arrang bag deliv apart dalla final destin put claim address dalla final destin book separ flight home american follow thursday get voicemail say bag dalla airport need know whether mail want pick callback number voicemail work work drove airport get bag told sent back toronto hear appar know dalla final destin even though clearli claim send back claim origin made decis send back less half day give littl time respond even respond anyth submit claim toronto told would fedex ed apart dalla need wait circl way back dalla wait get bag back never fli air canada
"Not Verified|  First they claimed my flight was cancelled due to weather, then not the weather but staff shortages, then just cancelled. They offered me a flight that arrives 12 hours after my original flight arrival time (Flight time is 1.5 hours). I'm guessing the mystery was to avoid pay-outs for cancellation, and we did have to upgrade to business to get the same flight path. Recent comments from staff suggested shortages in work, no breaks and long hours. What we witnessed was untrained staff, staff on their cell phones, and a general ""not my problem"" approach. If you are going to have poor service, sloppy security and mediocre lounges, my request would be to remove the ""Canada"" from the name. Just call the company Air. We are all hoping things improve, but staff will need some assistance to get there.

"Not Verified|  Air Canada was terrible to fly with. There’s not much I could compliment. I usually fly Qantas direct or Virgin Australia via the US to come to Vancouver, but this time decided to give Air Canada a go. I wouldn’t recommend this airline. Upon leaving Sydney the flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours extra because of some baggage issues. Okay these things can happen, at least allow your passengers to sit at the airport so they can walk around or buy some food or drink and are not stuck in a small airline seat in a cramped environment where they can’t walk around and no drinks are served to them. At least make your passengers comfortable and relaxed by offering them a water or juice or something. Nope none of that. What further annoyed me was that they kept saying another 15 minutes and another 20 minutes again and again for 2 hours. Furthermore the air hostesses were unfriendly and cranky. The flight back was just the same. First my flight was delayed by one hour which was fine. Then once again we were put on the plane and made to sit on the tarmac for a further two hours before our flight took off. A flight that’s meant to be 15.5 hours has now become a 17.5 long and uncomfortable flight. Not impressed with Air Canada at all and won’t be using them again.

"✅Trip Verified| Air Canada is without a doubt the worst airline I have ever experienced in my life. Prepare for a rant. We booked our flights through Norwegian cruise line and all of our flights to Italy were delayed by anywhere from an hour to 3 hours every time. But it turns out dealing with that was the easy part because the way back was a horrific nightmare. We get to the airport ready to go home and saw that our international flight would overlap with our connecting flight and the Air Canada attendant said that our flight was actually leaving earlier than what I was seeing and that we would have no problem making it, but if we did miss it they would handle everything in Montreal. So guess what? We missed out connection by over an hour because the international flighted ended up being delayed by 3 hours. To shorten the story from here we searched for our luggage for 4 hours with our entire flight of hundreds and ended up staying two nights in Montreal on our own dime because the airline staff here didn’t care at all and acted like it wasn’t their problem and just wanted to go home. It took standing at United instead of Air Canada and demanding a flight in order to make anything happen.

"✅Trip Verified|  Horrible airline from start to finish. We started in BNA (Nashville) and got the worst first impression. We walked in to a long line at the ticket counter that wasn’t moving at all. Employees were either standing there or conversing amongst each other. We get on our plane to Toronto and everything is fine and we even land a little bit early. Then, we get told we have to wait for an open gate. That’s fine, we didn’t mind it. We waited and waited and the captain got back on the PA and told us that he got lied to and that nobody was responding the whole time until after at least an hour past, and that we would have to wait for another gate to open. The captain then stated that one shouldn’t be long. He didn’t come back onto the PA until another half hour past to let us know they were about to clear that gate up. All in all it took us close to 2 hours to get into a gate. You would think this would have made us miss our flight to London Heathrow. But the good thing about Air Canada is that flight was delayed too. So we made it and didn’t take off for almost another 2 hours from the scheduled time because they were waiting on the pilot or first officer AND ground crew. We finally took off and arrived in LHR and were cutting it close to our next flight for Istanbul. We were hoping to get into a gate immediately this time.  We waited 30 minutes in the tarmac this time which inevitably made us miss our next flight. We get to LHR to find out that our bags weren’t there with us. I wonder what the two hour delay was for but that’s beside the point. If you had 2 hours extra, you would think they’d get everything right since they already had so much go wrong. We idk course just accept our fate and go get rebooked for the next flight out to Istanbul. Of course it was the biggest inconvenience for them to rebook us for their mistakes. I even got questioned as to why I couldn’t make the flight if we landed at a certain time which I then responded to the associate and let them know we had landed but we’re just hanging out on the tarmac with no gate. She had no response and didn’t even apologize for the accusation that we purposely missed the flight. Everything beyond this point got so much easier in terms of dealing with airport personnel.  We finally make it Istanbul and got make a report with Turkish Airlines to get our lost baggage. We would call everyday to get an update and it was something different everyday. I don’t blame Turkish Airlines for this. They didn’t lose the bag. They just are delivering it. I didn’t get my bag for 3 days and it was at night on the third day. So that left a total of just one day of the trip with my belongings. I had to wear the same outfit until I could go and maybe buy something else. My friend didn’t receive his baggage at all and they said it would be delivered the day we were leaving which means it would get here after we’re gone. He called Air Canada to see what they would do to make it all right and the response he got was atrocious. He kept getting told he would get his baggage for sure and they could deliver it to his home address.",horribl airlin start finish start bna nashvil got worst first impress walk long line ticket counter move employe either stand convers amongst get plane toronto everyth fine even land littl bit earli get told wait open gate fine mind wait wait captain got back pa told us got lie nobodi respond whole time least hour past would wait anoth gate open captain state one long come back onto pa anoth half hour past let us know clear gate took us close hour get gate would think would made us miss flight london heathrow good thing air canada flight delay made take almost anoth hour schedul time wait pilot first offic ground crew final took arriv lhr cut close next flight istanbul hope get gate immedi time wait minut tarmac time inevit made us miss next flight get lhr find bag us wonder two hour delay besid point hour extra would think get everyth right sinc alreadi much go wrong idk cours accept fate go get rebook next flight istanbul cours biggest inconveni rebook us mistak even got question make flight land certain time respond associ let know land hang tarmac gate respons even apolog accus purpos miss flight everyth beyond point got much easier term deal airport personnel final make istanbul got make report turkish airlin get lost baggag would call everyday get updat someth differ everyday blame turkish airlin lose bag deliv get bag day night third day left total one day trip belong wear outfit could go mayb buy someth els friend receiv baggag said would deliv day leav mean would get gone call air canada see would make right respons got atroci kept get told would get baggag sure could deliv home address

"✅Trip Verified|  This was the worst airline experience I have ever had. We booked tickets on Air Canada (myself and my 2 year old daughter) to fly premium economy to France. There was one stop planned in Montreal. All was well the night before the trip, checked in, bags packed, etc. I received a text notification at 11:30 pm that our flight had been rescheduled. I was asleep and so somewhat groggy when I checked the updated schedule that showed an 11:20 am departure (instead of the 9 am). The trip had been rebooked on United Airlines. I was annoyed but okay since this is just a slight change. I tried calling Air Canada immediately since I didn’t receive any additional information regarding necessary paperwork or documents to fly with United. I also wanted to confirm the trip. I tried to call Air Canada multiple times and received a message that the call volumes were high and so they would not be offering a hold. No other communication from this airline regarding these changes. I finally got through and was put on hold at 5:30 am in the morning with a wait of over 2 hours… I believe I was on hold for 2 hours and 10 minutes. When the representative checked my information I learned that I was actually booked on a flight schedule for the next day. I hadn’t noticed the date change because of the time of night when I looked at the notification. Air Canada then proceeded to explain to me that the first leg of my trip was delayed and I would miss the connection in Montreal so they booked me and my toddler for a different flight for the next day. There was nothing they could do for me and my only option for my flight is the next day as scheduled. I finally hung up and checked on the connections in Montreal Canada… there were at least 5-6 flights that were available as viable options to get me and my daughter to CDG on the original date that was planned. This has been the worst customer service and biggest nightmare. We have airport travel schedules, hotel reservations and other activities scheduled for our vacation that we will now miss but will still be charged because of the late cancellations.

Raleigh to Toronto air Canada flight AC8839 was delayed (from 5 pm to 7:pm) that resulted in missing connecting Toronto to Delhi air Canada fight Ac 42. No help or customer service at all provided at Toronto airport. Staff was very rude and clueless. They emailed new route Toronto-Doha-Ahmedabad with flight on next day 8 pm. Did not provide hotel just said everything is booked and nothing available. We just spent 24+ hrs on airport floor/benches. Doha flight AC58 was delayed as well. Finally we reached Ahmedabad almost after 50 hours to find that we did not receive our luggage. 3 bags they sent to Delhi.

"✅Trip Verified|  My Original flight was scheduled to leave by 10.30pm from SFO as direct flight. There is no weather issues at SFO and due to gusty winds in YYZ, the incoming flight was delayed and we all understand this circumstances as natural phenomenon. By 11.30 pm or so once we were in the flight the main door was still open and we were told that the bags were still to be loaded and some logistical delay. Three plus hours gone and still the main door was open and still no progress and I asked the one of the nicest flight attendant he said that there are no ground crews to load the bag and waiting for some solution. Today, by 10.30 Am (4.30 min after schedule arrival) finally we landed and was able to disembark the flight and after all the delay in the Immigration line, while waiting for the bags only realized that they have not loaded the bag. It is now almost after 2h from arrival we realized that part of our bags are not loaded. There is no responsible ground crew in the baggage claim area other than 4 people attending the long line of missed baggage people who can answer one customer for 10- 15 min to attend.

Not Verified|  Flight was delayed taking off from Dallas as pilots needed more rest time. Could not land in Montreal on account of bad weather. The flight was diverted to Ottawa where we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours. Flight took off for Montreal again but could not land this time because of excessive traffic. Plane then routed us to Toronto which resulted in us missing our flight to Athens. We were made to do customs and check out our bags in Toronto. We left Dallas at 1.45 pm and deplaned in Toronto after 10 hrs in the plane. No help whatsoever from Air Canada! Stayed overnight in Toronto airport. There was no support from the Air Canada staff.

They put me as number 5 on standby and I didn’t make it so I told my husband and daughter to go without me. How could they break up groups like this and not tell you until the last minute? It’s not like I paid for a lower fare, why would they bump me without prior notice and have no empathy at all for my situation? How horrible they treat their customers.

From the moment I walked into the airport with a stroller a suitcase a car seat and carry on luggage. A gentleman ran over to help me immediately. He completed my check in and tagged up all my items. He carried my suitcase to the belt, bagged up my car seat, and gave me directions to the security section. I couldn’t thank him enough and all whilst he was rushing around to help me he took the time to interact with my daughter. The cabin crew were amazing, constantly asking if myself or my daughter needed anything. I again received almost the exact treatment at the Winnipeg airport when returning home to Ottawa.

We end up booking a different flight out of Toronto with American Airlines spending over $1000, AC refused to refund or compensate us for the portion of the flight and also our luggage is still nowhere to be found.

"✅Trip Verified|  This company had made my vacation into nightmare. First the flight was delayed, then we did not get a gate at Pearson airport, so we stayed in the plane for 2 hours due to that I missed my connection. Now it is midnight. We got off and guess what. There was no one at the airport to help you from air Canada. No staff. We were told to stay at the airport whole night the staff will Arrive at 4am for the morning shift. Not to mention the night manager for Air Canada was there the entire time and did not come to help. Now that it is 4 am. We are made go from one aisle to other aisle. Now it is 6am finally the reservation area for re book open - they didn’t have any direct flight for next 2 days. No meal vouchers they wanted to provide. Even for the hotels, they will make you pay out of your pocket and then they will refund you later (which will be another nightmare to get your money back). Since I couldn’t wait for 2 days. Had to cancel with air Canada. Paid another $1500 to book with different airline for the same day. Now I am in baggage area to check out my bags with air Canada, so that I can check in with different airline. The manager at bagging area, refused to help. Her excuse was I do not have manpower now to send someone and grab your bags. She told me to go in my flight and once I reach the destination, I should report to air Canada counter for baggage. Not that I didn’t force her but she was absolutely useless. Since I had to get on the flight, I left. When I arrived at my destination airport, there was no air Canada office here. And the counter only opens when there is a flight schedule. So now I am stranded here without my baggage for last 5 days. No update. Trying to get a hold of the staff.

"Not Verified| London to Windsor via Toronto. Of 4 flights with Air Canada during a trip from Canada to Europe, all 4 were delayed and 1 was cancelled. No compensations were given for any of the flights and there were few to none help desk staff available at any of the airports. Our connecting flight from Toronto to Windsor after London England to Toronto, was cancelled, rebooked, delayed and then was cancelled the minute we touched down in Toronto. No other flight options were available that day and our bags were loaded directly onto a plane that would depart the next morning. The baggage offloaders specifically told us all bags are taken off the plane and unloaded at belt 6. We waited over an hour and our bags never appeared. We asked an Air Canada help desk and they said all cancelled flight bags are sent to belt 1. We waited at belt 1 and the bags never appeared, We asked another worker and they lead us around the airport to area where he said the bags would be and they were not there. We then visited a different Air Canada help desk, where the woman behind the counter got up and talked with a friend, instead of dealing with the line of customers. When we finally got to talk to the counter, they said they must be on the flight added for the following day and that we are not allowed to retrieve them. 5 different workers wasted our time and all gave different responses. The bags were said to leave on that plane regardless if we are on it. We could not wait until the following day and they would no compensate for a hotel, food or in any other way, So we had to Uber back from Toronto to Windsor and then pick up our bag from the airport the next morning. That flight was also delayed so our bags were still late. And nobody checks to see who is picking up the bags or if they belong to those people. They have now emailed us and said that rather than refund our cancelled flight for 180$ that they are refunding us $15.27.

Hours on the phone during the rebookings, multiple mistakes made. The Air Canada desks were absolutely inundated, requiring multiple hours to make overnight arrangements. To make matters worse there the staff we spoke to over the phone to try and arrange refunds had not a single empathetic thing to say.

"✅Trip Verified| No gate number displayed until about 20 minutes before boarding. This would have been OK if the gates were near, but at Heathrow it took 20 minutes or more to get to the gate. Once at the gate there was no call made for boarding, nor were people boarded section by section, resulting in a jumbled mass of passengers at the gate. No calls for those needing assistance or families traveling with small kids, who then had to jostle with others to board. Very disorganized and devil-may-care attitude right from the outset. The flight took some time to take off even after boarding, and for that I don't blame the airline - it could have been just heavy traffic at LHR. However, they took their own sweet time, even after take off, to distribute headsets, so we could at least watch something while waiting. They forgot to load one of the hot (snack) meals onboard, and so most of the passengers didn't get any. OK, we all make mistakes, but it's usually courteous and good manners to let the passengers know and apologize. Neither was offered - and passengers only knew what was going on only because some of the other passengers asked the cabin staff. Instead they decided to serve a bag of pretzel without explanation. Hands off, miserable and disinterested cabin staff. There are passengers who either need help stowing lifting up carry-ons into the overhead compartment or simply don't know the most space efficient way of stowing luggage per compartment. Usually (even on Air Canada) the cabin staff help with both. No help offered on this flight, so there were infirm people struggling and not enough space for some passengers to stow luggage because of other poorly placed luggage in the overhead bins. The cabin staff couldn't care less. Usually after a poorly managed flight, you'd think the cabin staff would like to salvage some of their poor customer service by at least saying goodbye with a superficial smile. These employees couldn't even manage that - they wouldn't even look at any of the passengers as they were deplaning.

Then refused to help and called security. When we cleared it up on the phone with a different airline we found out the flight was completely cancelled and other airlines refuse to work with them to give them tickets. After they “found” another flight they had no idea what airline the connection was with. Another thing we had to find out ourselves. After checking in we find out it was delayed another 4 hrs. After the original 2 hours to begin with. The people who work at the counter are utterly clueless and can’t tell the difference between the name of an airport and an airline.

"✅Trip Verified|  I’ve been flying for the majority of my life. As an Atlanta native, Delta has normally been the go to airline. However, this year as a part of a graduation trip I booked my trip and accompanying flights through a travel company. They chose Air Canada. I have never been so thoroughly disappointed with an airline experience. Staff was friendly and apologetic; however, the scheduling was consistently not met and ill communicated. Of course delays happen due to weather and other unforeseen circumstances; however, the lack of communication through Air Canada’s app and their insistence on a physical paper boarding pass were relics of a bygone era. Poor scheduling and communication make Air Canada a disastrous choice for anyone hoping to complete their journey in an efficient manner much less enjoy it.",fli major life atlanta nativ delta normal go airlin howev year part graduat trip book trip accompani flight travel compani chose air canada never thoroughli disappoint airlin experi staff friendli apologet howev schedul consist met ill commun cours delay happen due weather unforeseen circumst howev lack commun air canada app insist physic paper board pass relic bygon era poor schedul commun make air canada disastr choic anyon hope complet journey effici manner much less enjoy

I understood the limitations, but felt it necessary. It was also necessary to make the trip to support my daughter during a medical procedure. The error was devastating, I thought I had lost the total payment of the ticket and would have to rebook and repay the full amount. Apart from the loss of dollars, I felt silly making such a careless mistake. I called the ticketing agents and after an almost two hour wait, I spoke to ""L"" at approximately 4pm Saturday May 28/22. She was so patient and understanding and assured me she could help. Further, she comforted me by commenting there were those that had made far sillier mistakes than mine. She re booked the tickets for the correct days, assigned seats and sent a refund voucher for $20.00. The whole encounter was a successful and uplifting experience in a world where that happens infrequently.

Then flight was cancelled. After removing the passengers from the gate area we were given poor instructions on next steps. Air Canada kept my checked bag for the night. When I got to a ticket agent I was assigned a new ticket for the next day and then essentially kicked out of the airport. Because I was starting my travel that day from Toronto it was there policy not to provide hotel, transportation, or food, even though I live in the US and had no place to go. That sucked. Fast forward the next day. More delays at the gate. Finally got on the plane. Sat on the plane for over an hour waiting to get pushed off.

"✅Trip Verified| I have flown many times over the years with different airlines. Air Canada is the worst airline I've ever seen. First of all, what I didn't realize before buying the ticket is that the website is quite amateur and has many shortcomings. Sometimes you may not be able to access your flight information even if you want to. You may have to wait a few hours. Sometimes, when you are looking for a new ticket, you may not be able to make the search you want. Sometimes you even have to wait a bit to log in to your account. Things get worse when it comes to customer service. If you're in a hurry, you definitely can't get your work done via email. It takes at least 2 days to get a response, sometimes even longer. If you want to call by phone, you have to deal with customer representatives who are unaware of their work. You get conflicting information with each phone call. Customer representatives are definitely not there to help you. They just give you simple information that you can also access from their website. I wouldn't recommend calling them for help when you have a problem. It would be more convenient to cancel the ticket directly. I was going to travel to Turkey via Canada. I could not find even the slightest information on the website that said I needed a visa to make a transit flight from Canada, so I was not allowed on my flight. At least 3 different Air Canada employees told me that the online visa would be finalized in 2 days. So I started to consider buying a new ticket for 5 days later. However, if you are going to buy a new ticket, you cannot buy a ticket from the standard category, they force you to buy it from the flex category. But the greatest injustice begins here. When you look at the advantages of the flex category on the website, it appears to be fully refundable. But in the phone call I made with customer service, they said that there was no such thing and I could not get a refund. At that time I claimed on the website that we had been lied to and the only answer I got was no. Despite what I saw with my own eyes, no explanation was given, denying that we are not lying. In a different phone call, I was told that they sold my new ticket in the flex category, but I could not benefit from the advantages of flex since the first ticket I bought was in the standard category. Now they say I can get a refund of $800 for my flight that I paid $1800 in total. Or as a travel voucher, I could get the entire amount back. But to use the travel voucher, I need to fly somewhere through Canada because this airline operates all flights through Canada to save money for the Canadian government and its own airlines. There are no flights within the US, so it's almost impossible for me to use that travel voucher. Because of this, I bought a new ticket from United Airlines and paid another $1850. Even calculating my financial loss is quite difficult, but I know that I have lost a lot. I don't even want to think about the psychological damage, I spent 2 days on the phone dealing with all this nonsense because it can take you over an hour to reach someone due to the lack of customer service staff. In short, I would not recommend anyone to use this airline. It will be more profitable for you to pay $100-$200 more and fly with higher quality airlines.",flown mani time year differ airlin air canada worst airlin ever seen first realiz buy ticket websit quit amateur mani shortcom sometim may abl access flight inform even want may wait hour sometim look new ticket may abl make search want sometim even wait bit log account thing get wors come custom servic hurri definit get work done via email take least day get respons sometim even longer want call phone deal custom repres unawar work get conflict inform phone call custom repres definit help give simpl inform also access websit recommend call help problem would conveni cancel ticket directli go travel turkey via canada could find even slightest inform websit said need visa make transit flight canada allow flight least differ air canada employe told onlin visa would final day start consid buy new ticket day later howev go buy new ticket cannot buy ticket standard categori forc buy flex categori greatest injustic begin look advantag flex categori websit appear fulli refund phone call made custom servic said thing could get refund time claim websit lie answer got despit saw eye explan given deni lie differ phone call told sold new ticket flex categori could benefit advantag flex sinc first ticket bought standard categori say get refund flight paid total travel voucher could get entir amount back use travel voucher need fli somewher canada airlin oper flight canada save money canadian govern airlin flight within us almost imposs use travel voucher bought new ticket unit airlin paid anoth even calcul financi loss quit difficult know lost lot even want think psycholog damag spent day phone deal nonsens take hour reach someon due lack custom servic staff short would recommend anyon use airlin profit pay fli higher qualiti airlin

We sat for 3 hours outside the gate waiting for the door of the terminal to be unlocked. Air Canada service desk reply “not our fault”.

"✅Trip Verified| Air Canada is an awful airline, literally the worst customer service. It is clear that making money is more important than offering quality service. Because we left late and it took an hour for them to let us out of the plane, I missed my connection. Not a single Air Canada employee (flight attendants, customer service reps at the gates or in customer support, the phone-based customer support included) had any idea of what to do to support the people that missed their connection. The best we got was a person handing out a card with the various phone numbers to call to try to get help. I was on hold waiting to be helped for over an hour on 4 different occasions. During two of the calls, the customer service rep hung up on me because they didn’t know the answer to the question I asked. I was also told they didn’t know exactly where my luggage could be or how I could pick it up. In person, the customer service person was rude and only directed me to the phone numbers on the card.

"Not Verified|  Air Canada is hands down the worst airline I have ever taken. I fly a lot, and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a singular airline. They always delay or cancel flights (with usually terrible excuses) and rebook you on worst next day flights without respecting your time. When you attempt to change the flight by calling their customer service, they typically have very long wait times. If you then choose to talk to a representative in the airport, they are very very rude in person, saying it isn’t their fault either, and are generally very unhelpful. They often delay your baggage too, something I have experienced multiple times. They are becoming worse as an airline by the year, its getting ridiculous. I believe this is a case of lack of competition in Canada. WestJet and Air Canada basically owning a monopoly on flights in Canada means us Canadians are forced to book with them and put with their terrible terrible airline without many other options. Something needs to be done because this is getting ridiculous. Air Canada, please sort out your terrible airline.

"✅Trip Verified| The worst airline I have ever flown with. Let's start at the check-in counter at Toronto airport, the counter attendant didn’t know what she was doing, she messed up my existing boarding pass and tried to re-issue my new seats and a boring pass (which she didn’t know how to do and then she has to ask someone else for help). She then wanted me to repay for additional luggage charges, which I had already paid before. I asked her to get her manager so I can explain the situation she didn’t want to call the manager, but after insisting her and demanding to see the manager she finally called the manager. I asked the manager to provide me with his and her details so I can complain/send my feedback. The manager refused to provide any details about the counter officer and replies ""sorry due to confidentiality I cant provide you with her name"". I went back to the counter and asked for her name, she gave me only her last name and then walked off. Next is the In-flight experience which was worst as well, flight attendants are rude and ill-mannered. There is no sense of customer service and politeness. The attendant didn’t care if you called them for help, they just walk off and turn the assistance bell off. The meals were half-frozen. Limited in-service of water and any other drinks. Flight attendants were rude and grumpy. I travel a lot due to work and other commitments and have flown with many airlines, but Air Canada is the worst of the worst.

"Not Verified|  The absolute worst experience of my life. My five friends and I booked a trip to Toronto using Air Canada. Our flight was at 6am, we arrived four hours before departure only to see that our flight was delayed 4 times and we were placed on two separate flights, one with a two hour layover and one without. The first delay occurred at 9am, 10.40am, 12.15pm then approximately 2.55 until it was officially cancelled. We completely understand the unfortunate event of delay, malfunction or simply weather conditions, however we expected at least kind customer service from the staff of this 'business'. The 'supervisor' on duty rolled her eyes at our simple questions and left everyone in a panic. She even uttered the words 'I don't care, that's not my problem'. She is the definition of what not to do when representing a business or team. We were left needing to book a hotel on our own expense and did not receive any compensation for anything whatsoever. One of my friends was in need of a wheelchair as well so I called an employee for assistance, she seemed bothered by this since she was forced to get up from her chair and pause her social hour with another coworker. She sighed and proceeded to lecture me about how it was our fault that he did not have any assistance.",absolut worst experi life five friend book trip toronto use air canada flight arriv four hour departur see flight delay time place two separ flight one two hour layov one without first delay occur pm approxim offici cancel complet understand unfortun event delay malfunct simpli weather condit howev expect least kind custom servic staff busi supervisor duti roll eye simpl question left everyon panic even utter word care problem definit repres busi team left need book hotel expens receiv compens anyth whatsoev one friend need wheelchair well call employe assist seem bother sinc forc get chair paus social hour anoth cowork sigh proceed lectur fault assist
"✅Trip Verified|  This is my first time flying with them though it wasn't by choice as it was a code share with ANA. The experience with ANA and Air Canada was night and day (ANA being day). I was told at the check-in counter in Bangkok that my baggage will be checked though Toronto but need to go through the immigration in Vancouver. OK. I've almost missed my flight to Toronto as the immigration and security process at YVR took so long and confusing. There was an Air Canada staff at the security line but didn't do anything to help when asked. It was 10 mins pass boarding time and I was still on the security line. All I had for the answer that, you will need to ask others in the line yourself! Luckily, there were about 6 of us on the same flight in that line so we worked together to get through. When arrived in Toronto, I was waiting for my baggage for 20 minutes, saw nothing, and next flight baggage were about to arrive. I turned to the ground baggage desk for help informing that I've been waiting for 20 mins for my baggage. She said sometimes you need to wait for 45 mins without asking any further information from me! I was not stupid! Next flight baggage were coming and mine didn't show up. There must be something wrong! I had to talk to her colleague to file a report of mishandled baggage which took another 15 mins! Nightmare! They said 'I don't see your baggage on the flight. 24 hours, you should have your baggage delivered to your hotel!' OK - 24 hours! Turned out, I needed to wait for almost 72 hours for my baggage to arrive and had to follow up with them everyday. No email update on status. When I filed for the claim, they took 3 weeks to respond my email. Another 1 week to update me that they have received my banking details. And I need to wait for another 3-4 weeks so the request is issued! Why do I have to wait for my own money that I didn't need to spend in the first place because of Air Canada's fault? The whole process is just too long and inefficient. No service-mind and proper customer-handling protocol. By far, Air Canada is the worst airline I've ever flown.

"✅Trip Verified| Disappointing Business Class service between Toronto and London considering the price paid. Nice dinner menu but by the time they got to the back of the business cabin there was hardly any choice left. The only option available to my son was a mushroom ravioli - and he hates mushrooms with a passion. The male cabin crew clearly wanted to be anywhere else - a friendly attempt at conversation by asking which wine he would recommend was met with a grumpy ""we don't drink it, we just serve it"". It's as if they've got aircraft with business seats so they need to fill them but then try to get away with offering a semblance of a business class service. To cap it all, when we arrived at Heathrow, it turned out all our bags were still in Toronto. Will have to seriously consider other options before flying business with Air Canada again.",disappoint busi class servic toronto london consid price paid nice dinner menu time got back busi cabin hardli choic left option avail son mushroom ravioli hate mushroom passion male cabin crew clearli want anywher els friendli attempt convers ask wine would recommend met grumpi drink serv got aircraft busi seat need fill tri get away offer semblanc busi class servic cap arriv heathrow turn bag still toronto serious consid option fli busi air canada

"Not Verified|  I normally don't write complaints, but I had to this time around. I was flying from Ankara, Turkey to Las Vegas with stops in Istanbul, Munich and Toronto. After disembarking from my plane in Toronto, I was told that my baggage was not transferred to my final flight, but I was reassured by the help desk that my luggage would be on the next flight the following morning to Las Vegas. Upon arrival, I went to customer support to file a delayed bag. I made it to my home in Washington, Utah, exhausted from traveling over 30 hours. I waited and waited, but my bag was not scheduled to arrive in Las Vegas until the 14th, four days after I had already arrived home. I finally got my bag just now on the 15th and I am disappointed that it took this long. How hard is it to put my luggage on the next flight? I can understand a wait of up to 48 hrs, but 5 days, come on. I had a trip planned with my roommate that I hadn't seen in over two years and I had to cancel because I had zero clue as to when my luggage would arrive. Also, this has happened before to my sister and mom with Lufthansa, flying into New York, and they had their luggage delivered to them the next day. I just want to know why it took so long. I have nothing against the airline workers, they were all kind and helpful to me, but I don't see myself ever flying with Air Canada again. Sorry, but a five day wait time is unacceptable.

Not Verified|  This airline is disorganized and deceiving. My first mishap was my trip from Newark to Toronto in Jan. 2022. It took nearly 4 days for my bags to arrive but during those 4 days I was lied to about where my bags were being told once that my bags were in Toronto and then next that they have not left the Newark airport. After that situation I gave Air Canada another chance for my trip from Toronto to Dallas. Because of a delay which would cause me to miss my connecting flight I was redirected to a direct flight.  I received a text that my bag would be delayed and would land with the next flight which landed at 8:33 pm that evening (5/11). I call that evening and they say my bags are in Dallas and should arrive the next morning by 11 am. The next morning at 8 am I call to inquire about the status of the bags just to find out my bags were not loaded onto the flight that was supposed to land at 8:33 pm and they were still in Toronto. So not only was my bag delayed but I was lied to by this airline. I am currently typing this on 5/12 at 11:50 pm and they said I would receive the bag this evening but I have not yet received it. This is now the second time this airline has deceived me like this and I am dealing with this confusion and my trip in Dallas is barely 3 days.,airlin disorgan deceiv first mishap trip newark toronto jan took nearli day bag arriv day lie bag told bag toronto next left newark airport situat gave air canada anoth chanc trip toronto dalla delay would caus miss connect flight redirect direct flight receiv text bag would delay would land next flight land pm even call even say bag dalla arriv next morn next morn call inquir statu bag find bag load onto flight suppos land pm still toronto bag delay lie airlin current type pm said would receiv bag even yet receiv second time airlin deceiv like deal confus trip dalla bare day
"Not Verified|  I have flown this route multiple times with other airlines without a problem, but this trip with Air Canada each way was an absolute disaster. I typically try to find the good in situations, but this was horrendous all the way around. Our first plane sat on the tarmac for an extra 1.5 hours. We weren't allowed to board, to the point the flight attendants were questioning what was going on and the gate agent wouldn't answer them, causing the flight to be delayed. When we arrived in Canada late, half of our flight had to full on sprint to our connecting flight. On the connecting flight, I was charged for full-flight WiFi access (this was fine as I expected it), but then when 12.01am hit my WiFi discontinued and I needed to purchase it again. My return flights were somehow worse. When I boarded my first flight there was an individual sitting in my seat who outright refused to get up. When I asked an attendant for assistance in moving them (literally part of their job description), he looked me in the eyes and then walked away to pack bags to make it look as if he were busy. As a broad person standing 6'2"" who purchased an aisle seat 2 months prior to this flight, it is fair to say I was upset to then be jammed into a middle seat that wasn't mine. Towards the end of the flight when breakfast was being served they told us ""we decided not to make coffee"". This is typically fine, but considering how awful my experience had been to this point combined with the fact they didn't give an explanation when I asked just dug the knife deeper. I had 3.5 hours before my connecting flight home (this was no issue as I knew it when I booked my trip) and Air Canada, in that time, was somehow only able to get one of my bags to my next flight. Again, 3.5 hours to move a bag across the airport to a flight only 40% full. They returned my second bag the next day at 6am waking my entire house. I can not stress enough how I will never again use this airline and make sure that no one I know flies with that garbage airline.

"✅Trip Verified| San Francisco to Copenhagen via Toronto. They are so unorganized and inefficient! I have no video of how they are capable of losing so much luggage, each bag with its own tracking number and sticker! So many people on our flight arrived in Copenhagen with no bags and the airline could not track them. It has been 48 hours since our flight and they still have no idea where the bags are, which makes no sense. Customer service sucks. They are so inefficient and the level of English was so poor that I could not understand them and my native language is English. We are stuck after two days, still no luggage or sign of it. I felt horrible because a nice lady on our flight was vacationing with her mom on a 7-day cruise and her bags disappeared as well. She had to leave on her ship the day our flight arrived with nothing but her carry on bag…they told her (and us) to file a form and check back online after a couple of days - seriously? How do companies like this make it out there? There were so many angry passengers on our flight. On top of that, our flight was delayed for over an hour. Now that I won’t even complain about but losing our bags, with no way of tracking them and telling us to leave the airport and get on a website to file a form is totally unacceptable!

"✅Trip Verified|  This flight with Air Canada was the first time food / drink was only served in the first and last hour of the route. A lunch was offered about 30 minutes after takeoff and no other food or beverage was offered until 7.5 hours later. Water was not offered mid-flight. A disgusting tomato / chicken paste hot pocket was offered as a snack before landing. When I requested a coffee to accompany the snack, the attendants explained that no hot drinks were offered ""due to COVID"". How much longer are airline attendants going to hide behind this excuse?  How does offering tea or coffee compromise the health and safety of passengers? Because the 2nd meal service was offered less than 30 minutes before touchdown in Toronto, attendants were scrambling to collect garbage and prepare the cabin for landing. Besides the food, there was an incident involving a bathroom and smoke alarm. In the middle of the flight, a gentleman appeared to have set off the alarm in the bathroom and flight attendants only checked on the incident after 1 minute.",flight air canada first time food drink serv first last hour rout lunch offer minut takeoff food beverag offer hour later water offer mid flight disgust tomato chicken past hot pocket offer snack land request coffe accompani snack attend explain hot drink offer due covid much longer airlin attend go hide behind excus offer tea coffe compromis health safeti passeng nd meal servic offer less minut touchdown toronto attend scrambl collect garbag prepar cabin land besid food incid involv bathroom smoke alarm middl flight gentleman appear set alarm bathroom flight attend check incid minut
✅Trip Verified|  Recently took an Air Canada flight from YYZ - LHR an evening flight . I have flown with AC for the past 5 years to Toronto and I think my recent return trip will be my last. I am fed up with being spoken to like a naughty boy by flight crew. Good manners in what at times must be a stressful role should always be adhered to. Last weeks flight was the final straw. The rude and abrupt tone that they all seem to use when requesting the most simplest of instructions leaves you feeling rubbish and not like a customer at all. Mid flight asked for some water and had to ask another crew member 30 mins later for the same bottle of water. Food is poor and the only smiles I saw from them was when they were kicking us off at LHR.

"✅Trip Verified|I departed Lisbon at 8:15 p.m. on 4/23/2022 I had a COVID test done in Lisbon the day before @10:40 a.m, so my test results should suffice to let me complete the trip. The AC ground agent and her supervisor at Heathrow airport refused to issue a paper boarding pass because they said that my test results had expired!!! They wanted me to take a new test, but there was not enough time to go through British immigration and customs to go landside in taking a new test and to go through security again, so they relented in giving me a boarding pass, but I would not have a pass in Vancouver until I have a new test done in Vancouver. I exited the plane @11:05 a.m. in Vancouver asking different people how to get a Covid test because the flight crew and the ground crew meeting at the door did not know. My connecting flight would be at 1:10 p.m. I had to go through Canadian immigration and customs before reaching the check-in counters where the Covid test stations were located. The test in Lisbon only took 10 minutes to get the results while in Vancouver, the test took 30 minutes to get the results. By the time I received the results in my email, which I checked every 30 seconds, it was 12:15 p.m. Air Canada check-in counter clerk had to call the gate crew to see if it was Ok to issue a boarding pass. Air Canada agents are not empowered to think logically. My origination flight was at Lisbon with a valid Covid test result which should allow me to complete my trip without this extra step. Air Canada agents took this draconian and unreasonable measure as if the US will sanction their airline by breaking the 24-hour rule. The Aeroplan app is also not working most of the time I need it.

Kids meals were soggy cold fish fingers and nothing worked on the airplane. Our seats were rearranged last minute to the last business class row, so 0 sleep possible. No hot water as well, so no coffee, tea or any noodles we took ourselves for the kids (we try and pre-empt these thieves!) Airline lost my wife's suitcase and after 14 weeks, no one has even reached out to me to be helpful or comforting. They make you chase them whilst on holidays, being on the phone and waiting in long queues to receive help, which never comes. Not one competent person has assisted me in the numerous phone calls I had. Hundreds of Euros spent on these overseas calls and no one to even provide 1 normal answer even now after 14 full weeks, the person on the phone has no idea what is going on and is relying on old information.

"✅Trip Verified|  It’s important for Air Canada to revise the connections they offer for long distance flights as there is not enough time to arrive and go through all the stages (customs, baggage security check and walking on a reasonable pace to reach the terminal gate you will be flying from) without feeling stressed that you will miss the connection. I arrived in Montreal at 6:05am and my boarding time was 6:55am to Vancouver. There is always some delay after the landing and all the passengers being able to get their carryons and leave the plane. Before customs we were blocked by this very rude lady that was demanding the “ArriveCAN” receipt and people were having hard time to find while she was screaming that we didn’t have it, but we would not be allowed to board if we didn’t show it to the Air Canada attendant in Sao Paulo. After that you need to pass by the borders and it always take some time. It's never fast. Documents checked you need to head to a different area of the airport to pass security to connect flights. It’s better walk fast, or run with all your luggage otherwise you won’t have a chance. Once I got at the security, there was this huge line that I knew I would not make it if I didn’t talk to someone that I had a flight departing in less than 10 minutes. I approached this lady that seemed to be working at the security department and her first reaction was, very rudely, telling me that I was supposed to be in the Airport 3 hours earlier, and there was nothing she could do…that was my fault. When I tried to explain that I had just arrived from Sao Paulo and it was not me that decided the connections she put me on a different line (a little shorter). Security took longer.  After running with my bags half opened trying to find the gate of my flight, my only thoughts were that us customers pay a very expensive price and shouldn’t to go through this experience ever. I understand that, Air Canada has no responsibility on the rudeness of some of the airport workers in Montreal but the company needs to assure their customers have time to make to their seats on the plane. Next time I’ll be aware about the time between flights and I will certainly avoid any connection in Montreal.",import air canada revis connect offer long distanc flight enough time arriv go stage custom baggag secur check walk reason pace reach termin gate fli without feel stress miss connect arriv montreal board time vancouv alway delay land passeng abl get carryon leav plane custom block rude ladi demand arrivecan receipt peopl hard time find scream would allow board show air canada attend sao paulo need pass border alway take time never fast document check need head differ area airport pass secur connect flight better walk fast run luggag otherwis chanc got secur huge line knew would make talk someon flight depart less minut approach ladi seem work secur depart first reaction rude tell suppos airport hour earlier noth could fault tri explain arriv sao paulo decid connect put differ line littl shorter secur took longer run bag half open tri find gate flight thought us custom pay expens price go experi ever understand air canada respons rude airport worker montreal compani need assur custom time make seat plane next time awar time flight certainli avoid connect montreal

"✅Trip Verified|  I arrived to the airport in Frankfurt on Friday, April 1st at 11 am to board the flight at 1:05 pm going to Toronto (Canada). They had us wait for an hour until one person started checking people in. At 12:05 the lady at the counter said they could not find my ticket in the system and sent me to Lufthansa. The lady at Lufthansa called customer service and asked about my reservation with Air Canada. She said they were able to find it, but they changed the ticket from Air Canada to Lufthansa. After boarding flight LH 0470 all passengers had to wait almost 2 hours inside the plane since they were bringing in the food (catering). Because the flight was delayed I missed my connection in Toronto going to San Francisco. When I arrived in Toronto it was a mess; all of those who lost connections were told to go to different places, some were told to go to Air Canada Customer service, others were asked to go through security and then to the information booth. I spoke to a lady who said that Air Canada was understaffed and there was supposed to be someone helping those who lost connections after we left the plane. There was nobody helping and all the staff members seemed clueless as to what to do. At least 13 passengers were in the same situation as me. We had lost our connections and since we arrived at 7pm instead of 5pm and there were no other flights to our destinations. All of us who lost connections went through security and had to enter Canada to be able to get to the information booth at the entrance of the airport as they had told us to go. When trying to explain our situation to staff there, they would send us somewhere else or tell us to call customer service. I have traveled many times and this is the most disorganized experience I have had. We decided to wait next to the information booth and not move until someone came to help us. They tried to send us away and have us call customer service, but we did not have anywhere to go so we stayed there until someone came. We waited at the information booth and started calling the operator to get staff from Air Canada to help us. We needed to book new flights and we needed a place to stay for that night. We were in the airport for over 3 hours, until a group of people came to help and told us they were sending us to the Marriott hotel for that night. They gave us one voucher for dinner and one for breakfast and sent us away. We were at the airport from 7pm to 10pm then got sent to the hotel. I booked my new flight for noon the next day and asked if I needed to take a new covid test. Nobody had that information. Finally I decided to go to sleep at midnight and figure it out the next morning. In the morning I found that there was a Covid testing site at the airport and went to take the test. They charged me $60 Canadian dollars and I had the result in about an hour. After this I was able to board the flight and get to San Francisco.

"Not Verified|  My wife and I flew to Whitehorse for the purpose of assisting a family member. We were scheduled to return to NS on March 26th. It’s still cold and icy in the Yukon and my wife had the misfortune of literally slipping on the ice resulting in 3 fractures to her tibia and fibula. Surgery is/was necessary along with an added week post surgery as recommended by the surgeon. Flight change was necessary. I called Air Canada on the 25th knowing it was late but very little choice. Explained the situation and medical emergency. The kind gentleman at Air Canada rebooked us a week later. The added cost to us was $1838.79. For the two one way tickets. Just looking at money alone my feeling toward Air Canada in this specific incident is that they are deplorable. We have been the victim of an unfortunate accident, however Air Canada has by far caused the greatest grief. We will incur additional cost just staying the required week but being unable to simply exchange a ticket given these very specific circumstances is atrocious. Some years ago my wife and I had bags stolen with our passports in Spain. We had to stay extra days to acquire new passports, US Air was our carrier and when we explained our plight, waived the change charge. I have had mediocre experiences flying with Air Canada but this on takes the cake. If this is their hard line policy with no room to look at case by case circumstance then your policy sucks. Victimizing clients with no alternative. I did once all arrangements were made, without being personnel or berating, voice the view above. I felt compelled to write a review.

But Air Canada made me fill out an online case report in order to request a credit. However they have not responded to my cases, they provide no email or phone assistance (waited for 40min to find that out) and the online chat bot only tells me the cases are 'closed' with no explanation.

Instead of turning back to gate, we sat still on the tarmac for 6.5hrs, very little notice as to what was going on. Then they deplaned us and all they created was a bunch of angry mob at the gate, wasn't even organized with compensation as they seemed like idiots at the gate. They were more concerned in taking our duty free purchase than anything else, had to come back the next night and then even the flight was delayed by another 2 hrs. Lost a prepaid hotel day which they never compensated for, apparently I can't even file a claim with Air Canada because they say it's due to mechanical issue which I think should have been check before passengers were boarding.

My parents for the first time wanted to upgrade our experience from economy to premium and naturally our hopes were quite up and the excitement of what this experience will have to offer gave us a lot to look forward to.  The flight itinerary made the level of comfort, service and meal quality sound like it was worth the money we were paying yet that was not case. Firstly they served the dinner within 2 hours of the flight taking off, leaving the passengers for the remaining 12 hours depending on snacks. When I politely asked for some coffee from a hostess she gave me the most dirty look and claimed “the cart just came 5 minutes ago”.

"✅Trip Verified|  I had booked business class for my mother and for me I had booked economy. I wanted to upgrade my reservation for business. With the covid it was necessary to pass a test before leaving 48 hours before departure. While the possibility of raising the category of the seat was open up to 48 hours before departure. So I had the trouble of doing this upgrade, because the possibility was closed on the website, at the airport in Beirut, with my agency in Montreal, etc. I arrive on the gate at London airport after a stopover. they tell me that now it's too late to do the enhancement. The seats in the business section were almost empty and the staff had no power to act, all they tell you is company policy. I asked to pay for the upgrade, or to accommodate myself with an upgrade because my mother is an elderly person and she does not speak the language. They said they will take good care of my mother, something they did well but my mother did not feel comfortable because of the language barrier and they did not want to disturb the business section while during the 7.5 hour flight I was able to go see my mother 4 times only for 1 min only, so as not to disturb. I find that Air Canada does not give any power to act to its employees and it should have put a travel manager who listens to passengers and that we have the tools so that they can do the impossible to satisfy its clientele.

One example, when I have a 6:30 layover in Montréal while the airport is empty and most businesses closed I am unable to pay for lounge access, I am told you need to book ahead. Of course, I never seen any mentions of that before and no other airline do this kind of thing. I could see their lounge is mostly empty. They absolutely don't care about the passengers. If the company was not practically a monopoly and continually sponsored by my taxes and those of all Canadians, I wouldn't be so angry about it.

"✅Trip Verified|  Frustrating to say the least, I had to pack my patience. Went to visit my in-laws for the holiday as they are getting older and my mother-in-law really wanted us to visit. My husband and I got the the family together to travel we flew out of Orlando on Christmas day which was reasonable enough I give a pass to the attitude of the staff because it is Christmas day but the horrible part is returning home. We got all of our COVID test done on New Years Eve as we were traveling on New Year's Day, got to the airport in plenty of time(t3 hours ahead) and the incompetence was just mind boggling but we got through and told our bags would be checked all the way through to Orlando as we would pre-clear customs in Montreal and then head to Orlando. Well this is where it went batshit crazy. Our flight out of Vancouver was delayed by an hour we got into Montreal and Air Canada lost one of our bags so we were held up in US immigration because we couldn't clear customs without that one bag (which was mine) of course my family didn't leave me we all were stuck. At the last minute the agent filed a missing bag for to allow us to go through he then called the flight attendant on the plane we were scheduled to leave on and she was so rude and refused to hold the plane for five minutes so my family and I could run the 100m dash to the gate. We got through finally and yes they left us even though it was their fault we missed the connection. Had to trek down to the baggage department with absolutely do direction or help from Air Canada. We finally got back to the departures in Montreal after collecting our remaining bags and a bit of luck we ended up with an agent that was actually concerned and nice for the first time in this whole ordeal. She booked us on a flight in the morning and she arranged to put us up at a near by Marriott and $80 in meal vouchers she was amazing, it gave me hope. Got back to the hotel in Montreal only to get an email that the flight she booked us on in the morning was cancelled and we are now being bumped on to a Delta Flight through Atlanta into Orlando. We never arrived in Orlando until January 3 at midnight.

"✅Trip Verified|  I have rarely had a connecting flight through Toronto Pearson Airport without my baggage being delayed. My flight from Las Vegas to Toronto was delayed twice and, even if I originally had a 3-hour layover to make it to my final flight, I had to run through customs, vaccination checkpoints and through security to make it to my connecting flight. I was told that my baggage was checked all the way to my final destination, but apparently it was not. I barely made it to my gate while the last passengers were boarding and in the end the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. At my final destination, half of the passengers had to line up at Customer Services because their baggage was delayed when connecting in Toronto. I was told that my baggage would be delivered at my address the following day, but it still has not been delivered. I spent one hour trying to contact a Representative on the phone to know if my baggage was on route (at 9.30pm) or at least if they could give me an idea of when I should expect it. However, when the person finally picked up, they could not tell me if it would be delivered on the following hours or the next morning. From now on I will avoid any connecting flights at Toronto Pearson Airport and, if possible, travelling with Air Canada.",rare connect flight toronto pearson airport without baggag delay flight la vega toronto delay twice even origin hour layov make final flight run custom vaccin checkpoint secur make connect flight told baggag check way final destin appar bare made gate last passeng board end flight delay hour final destin half passeng line custom servic baggag delay connect toronto told baggag would deliv address follow day still deliv spent one hour tri contact repres phone know baggag rout pm least could give idea expect howev person final pick could tell would deliv follow hour next morn avoid connect flight toronto pearson airport possibl travel air canada
"✅Trip Verified| I have never flown Air Canada and not had a problem. Their flights never leave on time, I have never made a connection with them before and getting a new ticket is impossible because their customer service is no good.

Reflecting on my flights this day, one had no pilot and the other no fuel. I don’t have to explain how unprofessional and frankly pathetic this service is.

The airline automatically rebooked my connecting flight because they were unable to transfer my bags in time, even though we made it to our gate with an hour to spare.

I saw all passengers did same thing I did. In addition, they announced after 1pm the delay of the flight departing at 1440. So I was expecting that boarding would start at 1400 but nothing happened and then I went to the crew asking what is going on. Then the crew said she was just waiting for the plane to arrive at the gate and did not give me the time window with so rude attitude. After that one crew announce that they were just waiting for more information at 1400. Also another announcement stated that they were just waiting for the plane at 1430 without any apology.

"✅Trip Verified|  I brought some collapsible hiking poles in my carry-on luggage from Washington DC through Toronto to Calgary on my outbound trip, and then from Calgary to Toronto on my return trip, with no issues from security. But then during a separate pre-US arrival security screening from Toronto to Washington DC, I was told by security that I could not travel with them in my carry-on luggage and my only choices were to abandon them or try to speak to an Air Canada representative to put them in an additional checked bag. After deciding on the latter because of the value of the items, the Air Canada rep I spoke to, went out of his way to shepherd my sister and I all the way out through customs and back in again through security, getting us to the front of the line when he could and when it was appropriate, so that we could make our connecting flight on time. I have never experienced such good customer service with an airline like that before (despite the original issue with my carry-on item). Aside from that, all Air Canada staff we encountered were very friendly and we had no issues on our flights, despite a brief mechanical delay at one point, which is pretty typical nowadays. The economy seats on our flights, for all legs, also seemed a bit roomier than many US airlines.",brought collaps hike pole carri luggag washington dc toronto calgari outbound trip calgari toronto return trip issu secur separ pre us arriv secur screen toronto washington dc told secur could travel carri luggag choic abandon tri speak air canada repres put addit check bag decid latter valu item air canada rep spoke went way shepherd sister way custom back secur get us front line could appropri could make connect flight time never experienc good custom servic airlin like despit origin issu carri item asid air canada staff encount friendli issu flight despit brief mechan delay one point pretti typic nowaday economi seat flight leg also seem bit roomier mani us airlin
"✅Trip Verified|  When everything goes smoothly, Air Canada is a good airline to fly with. The major problem with them is experiencing how they handle unexpected issues along the way. We were bumped off our flight from Vancouver to Tokyo because we wouldn't make our connection there and at the time, Japan didn't allow stay-overs in the country bacause of strict Covid restrictions. The way the passengers affected were treated from the time we got off the aircraft to the time we were re-booked on another flight the following day was horrible. They have good customer-facing people who are doing their best to deal with such situations, but as a major organization, their leadership never gives them the tools or budget to deal with it appropriately. They need to make major improvements in dealing with crisis situations as they occur. Increased authority at a mid-level management would certainly be a good first step. The managers appear to be doing their best to accomodate the stressful transitioning of customers throughout the airport, but they clearly lack discretionary budgets to keep customers comfortable during the process. No food, drink or emergency staff increases to deal with any of it. Every customer is treated like cattle, running through the loops on their own, not knowing where to go in the terminal to address the next steps, etc. I am rating Air Canada on a corporate level, not on an individual customer-facing staff level.",everyth goe smoothli air canada good airlin fli major problem experienc handl unexpect issu along way bump flight vancouv tokyo make connect time japan allow stay over countri bacaus strict covid restrict way passeng affect treat time got aircraft time book anoth flight follow day horribl good custom face peopl best deal situat major organ leadership never give tool budget deal appropri need make major improv deal crisi situat occur increas author mid level manag would certainli good first step manag appear best accomod stress transit custom throughout airport clearli lack discretionari budget keep custom comfort process food drink emerg staff increas deal everi custom treat like cattl run loop know go termin address next step etc rate air canada corpor level individu custom face staff level

I had spoken to Air Canada on the phone and they said to me to speak to the attendants when the plane is fully boarded and if there is any space they will move you up. They said. No Sir.

"✅Trip Verified| I am a fairly frequent solo traveler (3-5 flights per year at a minimum) and this was the most disgusting experience I have had with an airline from the cancelation 7 hours before my flight in the middle of the night to the 24 hours delayed arrival to my destination. I had a flight booked for Sunday, August 29th, 2021 scheduled to depart at 7.00 am. I was in town for a wedding and this flight was a one-way direct flight from Halifax, NS to Toronto, ON. At 11.00 pm I received an email from the airline notifying me my flight was canceled ""Due to weather"". I called Air Canada to rebook my flight and after waiting on hold for 2 hours I got through to an agent who would only rebook my flight if I paid an additional fare. He advised me if I wanted another flight for the next day I could get on an 11.00 am flight for an additional $600 or a 7.00 pm flight for an additional $300. This is in addition to the $400 I paid for the initial flight. After much back and forth I requested a supervisor at which point he transfers me through, the supervisor introduces himself, and as I begin speaking he proceeds to hang up on me. I was infuriated as it was late at night and I had nowhere to go and no flight for the next morning. The next day, I call the airline back in the morning (attempting to get someone who would put me on the 11.00 am flight without charging double the amount of the original ticket). I was transferred several times, and on the phone for a total of 5 hours before securing a flight that evening at 7.00 pm and was required to pay the amount of the original flight and they said they would refund the initial ticket (total paid before a refund is not $800 for the flight that was $400 when purchased 2 months before the flight). However, my flight was now scheduled to go to Newfoundland overnight and then in the morning depart to Montreal then Toronto for my final destination. The agent on the phone advised me that when I arrived in NFLD they would be able to help with the hotel situation. I ended up having to pay for the hotel out of pocket ($150 for the hotel + the $800 for the flight = $950 trip so far) when I arrived at the airport because the agents had no idea what I was talking about. Finally, the next morning at 9 am (26 hours after my regional flight and $950 dollars later) I arrive in Toronto. When I get here, not surprisingly, my bags did not make it. They were delivered to my location a day and a half later. I wanted to leave this review to share my experience with Air Canada. I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline, the fact that it is incredibly challenging to speak to anyone, the fact that Air Canada treats its clients as numbers, and the fact that this conglomerate is a company solely focused on making money and has little care about the people affected on their flights. Things may seem okay with this airline when nothing goes wrong (which is seldom) but when it does go wrong, expect your trip to cost more and to spend hours online trying to talk to someone.",fairli frequent solo travel flight per year minimum disgust experi airlin cancel hour flight middl night hour delay arriv destin flight book sunday august th schedul depart town wed flight one way direct flight halifax ns toronto pm receiv email airlin notifi flight cancel due weather call air canada rebook flight wait hold hour got agent would rebook flight paid addit fare advis want anoth flight next day could get flight addit pm flight addit addit paid initi flight much back forth request supervisor point transfer supervisor introduc begin speak proce hang infuri late night nowher go flight next morn next day call airlin back morn attempt get someon would put flight without charg doubl amount origin ticket transfer sever time phone total hour secur flight even pm requir pay amount origin flight said would refund initi ticket total paid refund flight purchas month flight howev flight schedul go newfoundland overnight morn depart montreal toronto final destin agent phone advis arriv nfld would abl help hotel situat end pay hotel pocket hotel flight trip far arriv airport agent idea talk final next morn hour region flight dollar later arriv toronto get surprisingli bag make deliv locat day half later want leav review share experi air canada truli disgust servic airlin fact incred challeng speak anyon fact air canada treat client number fact conglomer compani sole focus make money littl care peopl affect flight thing may seem okay airlin noth goe wrong seldom go wrong expect trip cost spend hour onlin tri talk someon

"✅Trip Verified| Flying with Air Canada can be best described as slightly above-average. Not at all great, but most certainly not bad. The check-in agent in Portland who reviewed my flight and pandemic paperwork (to satisfy Canada's requirements) was very serious but also pleasant and helpful. The departure gate was relatively new, as well as secluded and quiet. The Portland gate agent was also courteous. The flight attendants were very serious and not much into pleasantries, but still pleasant when I needed to interact with them. The plane was a bit old, could have been slightly cleaner, but wasn't like a pigsty. The ticket was also a bit pricey considering that this was basically a 1-hour regional flight on a commuter jet (then again, I guess having to pay federal fees to the US and Canada for this flight might explain the price). Again, the experience was slightly above-average, I'd probably still choose them over American or Southwest in the US if I needed to fly to certain places outside of North America.",fli air canada best describ slightli averag great certainli bad check agent portland review flight pandem paperwork satisfi canada requir seriou also pleasant help departur gate rel new well seclud quiet portland gate agent also courteou flight attend seriou much pleasantri still pleasant need interact plane bit old could slightli cleaner like pigsti ticket also bit pricey consid basic hour region flight commut jet guess pay feder fee us canada flight might explain price experi slightli averag probabl still choos american southwest us need fli certain place outsid north america

"✅Trip Verified|  The flight 1421 Varadero-Toronto was delayed an hour. After we boarded the plane, the captain came on to say that we expect to be further delayed because of the paper problems with Cubans where supposedly they might return some of the passengers that he brought on his earlier flight form Toronto, which added almost another hour. Quite unusual, but well. During that hour of waiting aboard the plane, the crew kept reminding passengers via PA and directly to keep the masks on or face fines. Then they made an announcement saying they know we are getting hot and we are hungry and thirsty, but to be patient and once again keep masks on. The next announcement asked people sitting next to the windows to put the shades down so we would not be that hot. Each announcement was given in English, French and Spanish , so talking never stopped. Once we were up in the air, they could not get the safety demonstration video to play properly, so they told us in 3 languages again to read subtitles. The food service was then further delayed because they said there was a medical emergency. Finally, the cart with the food/drinks shows up. Yes, it is Covid, so told us the director of service, as she ""cannot pick up trash while offering food for purchase because she is not supposed to mix clean and dirty"". But the staff was supposed to use paper menu that every passenger touched, and was collected and passed to the next row. Totally, unpleasant flight.",flight varadero toronto delay hour board plane captain came say expect delay paper problem cuban supposedli might return passeng brought earlier flight form toronto ad almost anoth hour quit unusu well hour wait aboard plane crew kept remind passeng via pa directli keep mask face fine made announc say know get hot hungri thirsti patient keep mask next announc ask peopl sit next window put shade would hot announc given english french spanish talk never stop air could get safeti demonstr video play properli told us languag read subtitl food servic delay said medic emerg final cart food drink show ye covid told us director servic cannot pick trash offer food purchas suppos mix clean dirti staff suppos use paper menu everi passeng touch collect pass next row total unpleas flight
"Not Verified|  With over 15 years of travel experience I can definitely say this was the worst I experience. I have not flown on Air Canada for a while and will not be doing so in the near future. This was horrible from the clerk at the baggage drop-off to the boarding hostesses - rude and complete incompetence. It first started at the Air Canada luggage drop off point. The clerk pointed out that my carry-on was too big and requested I paid 115$ for the extra bag. So, I transferred everything to a small bag I had inside and to my other bags. When she weighed everything, one bag was 21 kg and the other 25 (2 kgs over the limit). She requested I remove the extra 2 kg or pay 100 $. I managed to remove the extra weight which she accepted. To my surprise at the gate, the hostess flags my boarding pass during boarding literally calling me a thief because I failed to pay the overweight and oversize fee. I was shocked, I tried to explain that this was an error and there is no way I made it through the security without paying. The hostess flat out told me I was lying and that there was no way for them to know I was telling the truth. They made me wait until all passengers boarded then a supervisor came and confirmed that I was telling the truth and that the clerk made a mistake. I was finally allowed to board. Please note: no apologies were offered for the inconvenience. As I was walking to the airplane to board, I started to experience some cramps in my hips since I was standing for a long time. I had to stopped in the middle of the ramp and wait for the pain to stop. To add to my frustration, here come another hostess asking me to move or she will get my name off the plane! I explained that I am having a cramp and just need a couple of minutes. The lady repeated herself saying that I needed to move or else my name will be removed from the plane. When she saw I ignored her and was still holding my hip she run off to the counter saying - ""that’s it, I am removing your name from the flight"".. I was really shocked I have never had in one encounter so many unkind people. This was a night flight and I imagine everyone was exhausted but the treatment I received was beyond unimaginable. The humiliation over and over again. I am so disappointed and really hope this company starts holding their employees accountable for the way they treat their customers.",year travel experi definit say worst experi flown air canada near futur horribl clerk baggag drop board hostess rude complet incompet first start air canada luggag drop point clerk point carri big request paid extra bag transfer everyth small bag insid bag weigh everyth one bag kg kg limit request remov extra kg pay manag remov extra weight accept surpris gate hostess flag board pass board liter call thief fail pay overweight overs fee shock tri explain error way made secur without pay hostess flat told lie way know tell truth made wait passeng board supervisor came confirm tell truth clerk made mistak final allow board pleas note apolog offer inconveni walk airplan board start experi cramp hip sinc stand long time stop middl ramp wait pain stop add frustrat come anoth hostess ask move get name plane explain cramp need coupl minut ladi repeat say need move els name remov plane saw ignor still hold hip run counter say remov name flight realli shock never one encount mani unkind peopl night flight imagin everyon exhaust treatment receiv beyond unimagin humili disappoint realli hope compani start hold employe account way treat custom
Not Verified|  Air Canada has no class. They cancelled my return flight and left me stranded in Morocco. They would not allow my travel agent to exchange my ticket with another airline. At the last hour flight prices on other airlines had doubled. Air Canada offered a partial refund which did not cover half the fair to get home. Big loss for me and absolutely no service for stranded passengers. The head steward on my flight was a mask Nazi. I was very aware and cooperative. But it is very awkward putting on a mask every time they pass you while eating or drinking. No common sense at all. As the walk towards you while eating you have to put a mask on.

"✅Trip Verified|  I booked a domestic flight (In the same province) originally on July 30th for 1:20pm. I showed up at Vancouver Airport at 12:00pm. It was my mistake this day for showing up too close to the time and I had to cancel because I missed the flight. Went back home All good I booked the flight through Expedia, got a refund and my expedia account was re-issued the credits again. Booked through Expedia for another flight for the next day to the same location. Flight was scheduled for 8:05am. Ok I decided to show up 2 and a half hours before the flight just to be safe. Get to the airport at roughly 5:30am, standing in line to check in and the lineup doesn't look too long. But They only have 3 people working the computers and the line moves incredibly slow. After almost an hour and twenty minutes of waiting in line I start to panic because I have only made it a little over halfway through this lineup. I start flagging down Air Canada staff to alert them that I may miss my flight if things don't speed up. Alerted one girl and she said : ""ok sir, someone will be over to assist you."" 15 minutes goes by with no assistance and I alert another girl. She gives me the same line as the other girl. And the same exact outcome. Nobody comes to assist me. After 15 more minutes I hop over the rope to the counter and beg them to please have someone come over and help me, or I will miss my flight. Again the girl tries to re-assure me they will help me and tells me to get back in line. Well after 2+ hours in line, and not one Air Canada staff coming over to help After I had asked. I'm one person away from being helped at the front counter. And just feel defeated. I step up to the front and talk to the girl and she tells me immediately that I have missed my flight. I can't describe my frustration, I even left well before my flight just to be able to make the flight in time. Two and a half hours before my flight and I still missed it. And this was a domestic flight. I have never in my life had to give myself so much time to make a flight, let alone a hour and a half flight. And still miss the flight. Air Canada offered no compensation and also did not appear to have any sympathy for my situation. I still had to fly up that day to go up for work, so I was desperate to get on a flight. Luckily a Westjet flight to the same destination was available. I walked over to the Westjet lineup, which was the same size as the Air Canada lineup. Managed to get through the line, book my flight and check on my bag within 15 minutes. Yes, within 15 minutes I did all of that. To top it all off, I canceled my flight through Expedia. Got the credit for Air Canada flights on my expedia account. Decided to try and book another flight with my available credit, but the expedia representative told me he couldn't book it because Air Canada had suspended my ticket, and I needed to call Air Canada to open it. Try to call Air Canada and they said they aren't taking any calls at the moment. Anyways I'm stuck with a 900$ balance for Air Canada that I now can't use until they get back to me. And will probably have to book through westjet to get back home which means even more money I will have to shell out due to Air Canada.

"✅Trip Verified|  I use to travel with Air Canada for many years and never had any issues. Since the past 3 years I've encountered several problem that I am now doubting Air Canada. On my way from BC to California the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff. The problem was coming back from California to BC. Unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when I landed in BC I had a connecting flight. I had to undergo the entire PCR, boarder security check. When I spoke to Air Canada I told them I have a connecting flight and with the looks of it I may not make it. I was told its okay we have time and my check-in was done so they will hold the flight for me. I got to security screening and long line up, I than again told the Air Canada person I have a connecting flight I need to go my flight will leave AT 5:20 which means boarding must've ended at 5:05 and I was at security till 5:10. I than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off! Air Canada did put me on another flight that took off at 8:45PM.

"✅Trip Verified|  Still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last September. Originally forced to get aeroplan points, then we could get refund via original form of payment. In April the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on. Then May 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said don’t call customer service, they can’t give you information. I have a diary of all the times I’ve reached out and never have I heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer.  Yesterday (8/24) I finally took on the 1hr hold thru customer service just trying to get information.

"✅Trip Verified|  Flight in Chicago had a 4 hour delay so we were delayed, almost missed our connection Air Canada let everyone off the plane instead of just the people with the imminent connections. Being on the back of the plane, things didn't look good Following that the agents barely listened to our questions on how to get to connections in time; instead directed us to customs and immigration. After 30 minutes in line, got to the customs agent, he says, ""why are you here? I'll walk you to connections."" Of course we missed the plane. Then the air Canada customer support agent in Toronto was useless. He let it slip that just the 4 of us missed our flight. And that it was our problem. We couldn't leave the airport and gave us one hotel room for 4 people. Went to CBP and again, they say ""why weren't you escorted""? We weren't supposed to walk where the Air Canada agents sent us alone.  I did file for reimbursement, but judging by the job Air Canada's done so far, that won't happen. They proceeded to lose our luggage and return it to us on our 9th and last day of our trip. Followed by not letting part of our party board because our recovery letter didn't said ""recovered from covid"" xx date signed by a doctor but missed the words ""for travel.""",flight chicago hour delay delay almost miss connect air canada let everyon plane instead peopl immin connect back plane thing look good follow agent bare listen question get connect time instead direct us custom immigr minut line got custom agent say walk connect cours miss plane air canada custom support agent toronto useless let slip us miss flight problem leav airport gave us one hotel room peopl went cbp say escort suppos walk air canada agent sent us alon file reimburs judg job air canada done far happen proceed lose luggag return us th last day trip follow let part parti board recoveri letter said recov covid xx date sign doctor miss word travel
"Not Verified|  Will try to never fly with Air Canada again after our experience.  Minutes before we were to board the final leg of a return flight from Rome, Italy - the Toronto to IAD Washington leg - AC7708, that flight was cancelled by Air Canada. All the passengers on what we were told was a full flight were directed to the AC customer services desk elsewhere in the airport. When we arrived there we learned another AC flight to Pittsburgh had also been cancelled. The Washington bound group joined at the back of this line of what was probably 300+ people. Over the next three+ hours no announcements to all the people in line were offered by AC customer service staff. At various times when Canadian citizen passengers, who were given vouchers on the spot and escorted past us out of the terminal by AC customer service staff, different AC staff gave incomplete and varying information in response to questions from non-Canadian citizen passengers. We were told we could not leave that area of the terminal due to Covid restrictions. We were told it would be days for us to find flights to final destinations - especially if there were multiple passengers on one booking etc. The total lack of guidance by AC staff to passengers led many to search for options. Also the customer service line was not moving as they were short staffed and having major computer rebooking issues. With 10pm approaching, no movement in the rebooking line, horror stories from other US passengers closer to the AC desk hearing rebooked flights for Thursday soonest etc., we felt we had to act. We began hearing also that Airport Security would not let us remain in the airport overnight. We secured a one-way car rental and drove 9 hours back to DC. At no time was a hotel stay offered by Air Canada or any talk of a voucher due to the cancellation. It was a total failure by them to communicate guidance for a situation that they - not the weather or other forces beyond their control - had caused. We are being told now by the Air Canada website that it will be 60 days for a reply to refund request due to a flight cancellation.",tri never fli air canada experi minut board final leg return flight rome itali toronto iad washington leg ac flight cancel air canada passeng told full flight direct ac custom servic desk elsewher airport arriv learn anoth ac flight pittsburgh also cancel washington bound group join back line probabl peopl next three hour announc peopl line offer ac custom servic staff variou time canadian citizen passeng given voucher spot escort past us termin ac custom servic staff differ ac staff gave incomplet vari inform respons question non canadian citizen passeng told could leav area termin due covid restrict told would day us find flight final destin especi multipl passeng one book etc total lack guidanc ac staff passeng led mani search option also custom servic line move short staf major comput rebook issu pm approach movement rebook line horror stori us passeng closer ac desk hear rebook flight thursday soonest etc felt act began hear also airport secur would let us remain airport overnight secur one way car rental drove hour back dc time hotel stay offer air canada talk voucher due cancel total failur commun guidanc situat weather forc beyond control caus told air canada websit day repli refund request due flight cancel

The plane we supposed to board got delayed for two and half hours at Los Angeles airport, we received food voucher there by an Air Canada agent. After landing at Toronto we got stuck on the plane for another one hour because of the traffic. Because of the covid situation we had to do our immigration and baggage claim in the Toronto airport. We were told by the Air Canada we will get hotel vouchers as we missed our connected flight because of the delay. We were directed to aisle number 7 and 8 of Air Canada for the hotels voucher. After waiting for about 3 hours in the queue when we got a chance to see the rep at the counter we were told that we are not eligible for the hotel voucher. And the representative didn’t want to help us and constantly misbehaving with us.  Later the manager explained it was not the airlines fault as we got delayed by the customs at Los Angeles airport. But we didn’t do our custom at Los Angeles. And he also added we will not get hotel voucher and will not get any compensation.

"✅Trip Verified|  I booked my flight from Toronto to Kamloops via Vancouver using reward points in June 2021. I booked my seat at the time of booking the flight - choosing 2A. A couple of days later I received a notification that my seat had been changed to 3A - not a big deal. On the 14th of August, I checked in online for my flight. A minute or two after checking in I received a notification that my seat was being changed to 28D - economy class, and minute or so after that another notification that my seat was changed again to 19D (may have been premium economy). I went into my bookings on the Air Canada website and my seat still showed as 3A. Next morning just to be sure I phoned Air Canada and after 1 hour 22 minutes, the agent confirmed I was in 3A from what she could see. I went to the airport and checked in at the counter and the agent printed me a boarding card for 19D. Told him this was not acceptable and explained what had taken place the day before. He then found an open seat in business class - seat 1D and gave me a new boarding card with my baggage tag attached. While going through security my phone alerted me to a message indicated my seat had changed and I was now in 27J (economy), and a few minutes later a new seat change to 21D, and then another change to 12D (Premium economy). Asked the agents in the lounge and they said I should go to the gate and check as it is a involuntary downgrade. The agent at the gate had my new boarding card for 12D. He said however I should wait until the entire plane boarded in case someone was a no show in business class. I ended up in 12D. There was absolutely no explanation as to why any of this happened, and how a person who has paid for business class (even if it was with points) can have their seat changed after they have checked in for the flight. It is now five days later and Air Canada has not compensated me. On top of this my connecting flight to Kamloops was cancelled due to weather and when I went to collect my bag and could not find it I realized that the agent did not transfer my baggage tag on my original boarding card to the new one printed. My take on this is that someone who was paying cash/credit for business class was given my seat as I was deemed dispensable because I purchased mine with my Aeroplan points. To not be offered an explanation or compensation is disgusting. Especially as I have been a loyal Air Canada client for many years and have flown business many, many times.",book flight toronto kamloop via vancouv use reward point june book seat time book flight choos coupl day later receiv notif seat chang big deal th august check onlin flight minut two check receiv notif seat chang economi class minut anoth notif seat chang may premium economi went book air canada websit seat still show next morn sure phone air canada hour minut agent confirm could see went airport check counter agent print board card told accept explain taken place day found open seat busi class seat gave new board card baggag tag attach go secur phone alert messag indic seat chang j economi minut later new seat chang anoth chang premium economi ask agent loung said go gate check involuntari downgrad agent gate new board card said howev wait entir plane board case someon show busi class end absolut explan happen person paid busi class even point seat chang check flight five day later air canada compens top connect flight kamloop cancel due weather went collect bag could find realiz agent transfer baggag tag origin board card new one print take someon pay cash credit busi class given seat deem dispens purchas mine aeroplan point offer explan compens disgust especi loyal air canada client mani year flown busi mani mani time

"✅Trip Verified|  The Signature Class check-in experience in Toronto was pathetic. There were only 4 us in the designated Signature Class check in hall but it still took almost 30 min. The agents seem confused. The lounge is a bare bones version of the domestic lounge (not Signature Class). So if you are flying from the gates you have to leave the lounge way in advance of your flight. An overnight, trans-Atlantic flight in business class had one cold dinner option consisting of a pea falafel. The mid flight snack was a basket of kit kats and nuts. Very limited drinks service. I woke up early and asked for breakfast. The flight attendant said I can't give it to you now because others will see and ask for it. Breakfast was even more pathetic: the menu said it was a croissant but it came in a plastic wrap with some fruit, etc. Given the state of breakfast, she could have easily served it to me when requested.

And for this, they charged me an extra 30 bucks.",despit arriv airport two hour flight got seat reclin overstuf aircraft pandem wait hour baggag upon arriv flight singl leg less hour never show wait hour return point anybodi tell anyth left hang fiddl bag charg extra buck
"✅Trip Verified|  I've flown with Air Canada more than any other airline in the past 5 years, and I've always ignored small unpleasant comments from ground and flight staff as well as poor organization and flight problems because flying Air Canada was often the only option available (or at least slightly more affordable) and I accepted it as a means to an end. However, my experience this week was awful. It started with a 3.5 to 4-hour line  to the check-in counter. We were told that self check-in isn't available so everyone had to wait in a single line. Most people ended up missing their flights. The airline only had four counters available and would not offer any communication to anyone who was worried about their flight.  At one point many of us reaching the front of the line were asked to break off and form a new line off to the side to make more space. After about 45 minutes of waiting, a new staff member asked us why we were standing there and told us our line doesn't lead anywhere. She told us we have to go back to the end of the line we were previously in if we wanted to be served. When other passengers became frustrated and mentioned that we have been waiting the longest and were asked to stand there, the ground staff responded that it wasn't true and that there was no way we've been waiting for 3 hours so far. Some people reacted by yelling while others started to cry from frustration. Once I finally made it to the check-in counter, I was told that all the other flights to Boston that day were full so my only option was to be placed on stand-by for all the flights in hopes that one of them would have extra space. I was told to wait at each gate one hour before a flight departs to see if my name was called. Luckily, I was able to board a flight that day and made it to Boston in the evening. When I arrived, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I went to the luggage service desk to inquire about it and was told that my luggage was not put on my flight because there was too much weight on the flight and it was better to take all the passengers to their destination than load all the luggage. If I knew this would have been the case, I would have much preferred to not board my flight and keep my personal items than arrive in a different country without my belongings. I was told the luggage would arrive on another flight and could be delivered to the place I was staying on the next day. I left all my contact information and had to hope for the best. The next day, I checked the online status of my luggage and it said that it had been loaded onto a delivery truck at 2pm. I waited and waited for it to arrive, but nothing came. I called Air Canada and they told me that the luggage will arrive anytime before 11:30pm. I didn't want to miss the delivery so I spent the first day of my trip just waiting. By midnight, no one had arrived. It is now the next day and I'm still waiting. Air Canada is unable to reach the delivery company.",flown air canada airlin past year alway ignor small unpleas comment ground flight staff well poor organ flight problem fli air canada often option avail least slightli afford accept mean end howev experi week aw start hour line check counter told self check avail everyon wait singl line peopl end miss flight airlin four counter avail would offer commun anyon worri flight one point mani us reach front line ask break form new line side make space minut wait new staff member ask us stand told us line lead anywher told us go back end line previous want serv passeng becam frustrat mention wait longest ask stand ground staff respond true way wait hour far peopl react yell other start cri frustrat final made check counter told flight boston day full option place stand flight hope one would extra space told wait gate one hour flight depart see name call luckili abl board flight day made boston even arriv luggag nowher found went luggag servic desk inquir told luggag put flight much weight flight better take passeng destin load luggag knew would case would much prefer board flight keep person item arriv differ countri without belong told luggag would arriv anoth flight could deliv place stay next day left contact inform hope best next day check onlin statu luggag said load onto deliveri truck pm wait wait arriv noth came call air canada told luggag arriv anytim pm want miss deliveri spent first day trip wait midnight one arriv next day still wait air canada unabl reach deliveri compani
"✅Trip Verified|  Supposed to be my original flight was July 31st YWG to YVR then YVR to NRT via Air Canada and layover of 24h 20m HND to MNL via Philippine Airlines. My flight schedule was changed several times by another booking agency. The time I was about to check-in in Winnipeg, Air Canada didn’t give me my boarding pass and didn’t allow me to board my plane because according to them, my layover in Japan should only be less than 24 hours in order for me not to avail a transit visa. I researched a couple of times before my flight and I found out that a passenger is allowed to transit to Japan without a visa up to 72 hours with a confirmed ticket and if there are no available flights on the said date of arrival. Air Canada told me to call my booking agency and to adjust my layover time. But there are no longer available flights possible for that day. I was forced to book a new plane ticket amounting to $2937.46 including taxes on an economy ticket for the next day.  Air Canada was so useless and I felt so disappointed because I have to travel back home again for an hour travel time and my brother who fetched me to the airport was already gone back home.  I found the airline very inconsiderate and I hope they will update their policies regarding transit visas.",suppos origin flight juli st ywg yvr yvr nrt via air canada layov h hnd mnl via philippin airlin flight schedul chang sever time anoth book agenc time check winnipeg air canada give board pass allow board plane accord layov japan less hour order avail transit visa research coupl time flight found passeng allow transit japan without visa hour confirm ticket avail flight said date arriv air canada told call book agenc adjust layov time longer avail flight possibl day forc book new plane ticket amount includ tax economi ticket next day air canada useless felt disappoint travel back home hour travel time brother fetch airport alreadi gone back home found airlin inconsider hope updat polici regard transit visa

"Not Verified|  I recently made reservations for a flight from Toronto to Newark on June 30th. My original reservation was for 230pm and arriving in Newark at 401pm. My flight was cancelled while sitting on the plane waiting for it to takeoff. The reason for the cancellation was ""a tornado warning."" Meanwhile in Newark it was 98 degrees and sunny. Everyone from that flight was made to stand on a long line while waiting on ONE customer service representative to attend to the 100 plus people from my flight and trying to assist an additional 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations. Needless to say the 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations were attended to while myself and the passengers that had been deplaned were told after an hour to come back tomorrow because our flight had been postponed to 8am the following day (July 1st). We had made reservations to drive from Newark to Ocean City MD for a two night stay but due to Air Canada we did not make it and we were only able to enjoy half a day and a one night stay and due to it being the Fourth of July no extensions were being offered. So we basically payed $400 for a room and extra for a flight with no compensations.  On July 6th at 8am I boarded a United flight from Philadelphia to Washington with and hour and half stop over in Washington where I was boarding an Air Canada flight at 1030am to Toronto. When I went to check in for my flight to Toronto I was told that the Covid test that I had taken was unacceptable and I was required to have a PCR test in order to board any flight to Canada. So I missed the 1030am flight, and went downstairs to get a rapid PCR test done. $250 USD later I received a negative PCR test and made my way back to the Air Canada counter to see if I was able to get on a later flight.  When I approached the Air Canada counter the gentleman rudely tried to give me a card with Air Canada's Customer service number (that I have been trying to call for days to find out information regarding Covid testing) I told him ""please don't try to give me that number you know  that no one answers that phone."" He went to the back to supposedly speak to someone and then quickly came back to me and stated ""We have another flight at 430pm but we are fully booked so we cannot help you. Anyways you should try United because it is their fault for allowing you on that flight this morning with the wrong test."" Long story short, I went over to the United counter and the gentleman who I believe was the supervisor,  stated to me that he would ""try his best to put me on a flight to Toronto."" He got me on the United flight from Washington to Toronto at 545pm, which I am grateful for.",recent made reserv flight toronto newark june th origin reserv pm arriv newark pm flight cancel sit plane wait takeoff reason cancel tornado warn meanwhil newark degre sunni everyon flight made stand long line wait one custom servic repres attend plu peopl flight tri assist addit plu peopl flight destin needless say plu peopl flight destin attend passeng deplan told hour come back tomorrow flight postpon follow day juli st made reserv drive newark ocean citi md two night stay due air canada make abl enjoy half day one night stay due fourth juli extens offer basic pay room extra flight compens juli th board unit flight philadelphia washington hour half stop washington board air canada flight toronto went check flight toronto told covid test taken unaccept requir pcr test order board flight canada miss flight went downstair get rapid pcr test done usd later receiv neg pcr test made way back air canada counter see abl get later flight approach air canada counter gentleman rude tri give card air canada custom servic number tri call day find inform regard covid test told pleas tri give number know one answer phone went back supposedli speak someon quickli came back state anoth flight pm fulli book cannot help anyway tri unit fault allow flight morn wrong test long stori short went unit counter gentleman believ supervisor state would tri best put flight toronto got unit flight washington toronto pm grate

"✅Trip Verified|  I flew business class on Air Canada from Newark to Doha via Toronto. I was connecting to my favorite airline, Qatar. I was looking forward to the service. However, AC was terrible. Check in at EWR was hectic. The agents did not pay attention to detail and gave me boarding passes belonging to someone else. Not a huge deal.  My flight arrived to Toronto late and I arrived at the gate just as they were calling for final boarding. I went to the agent and gave her all of the documentation she asked for without comment as I was catching my breath. At the end of it all, she said, ""you could be nicer you know"" I asked what her problem was and that I had given her everything that she asked for and that she was not particularly nice either.  The flight was terrible for business class. They had one menu with no options. The dinner was good, but breakfast was inedible. The seat was very comfortable and the flight attendants friendly. However, Air Canada has taken cost cutting in business class to a low. I connect to Qatar on a five hour flight. They had numerous menu options and better good. It is interesting how North Americans want to complain about the Middle Eastern carriers and their subsidies. However, the North American carriers get subsidies as well. Where they can't compete is service. If I am spending over $3000 on a business class ticket, and my choices are Air Canada or a Middle Eastern carrier, I would be a fool to spend my money on Air Canada.

"✅Trip Verified| Booked on-line a same day/one-way flight from Ottawa to Toronto on Easter Sunday. On-line booking and seat selection was normal although when the booking was made (just after lunch), there was only one flight for the remainder of the day. Booked a seat in Economy class and upgraded to Business Class on check-in at the airport. Security was moderately busy but once again, CATSA screening staff at Ottawa Airport were disinterested and not helpful (showed my boarding pass and was motioned to join the long economy queue, asked if that was the business line and then was motioned to join mid-way rather than being directed to the priority queue). After security, walked to the gate (Maple Leaf lounge at Ottawa is currently closed) and boarding was just commencing. Boarded quickly onto the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft and found my upgraded seat (4A) without issue. Flight departed on schedule. In-flight service consisted of a box lunch/snack along with a small water bottle, bag of pretzels, ear buds, promotional flyer about cleanliness protocols and sanitizing wipes. Seat was comfortable and in-flight crew were both attentive and professional. Flight arrived early and taxi in to the gate was quick.

In the business class cabin there was NO social distancing even though it was only one third full. The passengers behind me refused to wear their masks. The flight attendant requested they do so, at least 3 times. The electronics at my seat were not in working order and I kept drawing this to the attention of the attendant. I paid a lot of money for this upgrade and Air Canada refuses to refund my money.

"Not Verified|  Air Canada is truly a despicable airline. The reviews of the Customer Support Team are incredibly low, and unfortunately, I have to agree with them. The support members are rude with an attitude, and the entire experience with the airline has been putrid from start to finish. Due to multiple flight cancellations, it has taken Air Canada over 3 months to process flight refunds (which are still not received) despite being offered the refund ticket months ago. And with the support team, there are a myriad of excuses as to why the funds have not been processed. No one on the support team is capable of assisting, response time is despicable, and even the booking process is a mess.

"✅Trip Verified| From a service perspective, Air Canada is great, both on ground, on telephone and in the air. Their staff are polite, professional, practical and very accommodating. The pilots are well trained and provide sufficient information to the passengers along the route. The aircrafts are properly maintained and cabins are sufficiently clean. The main problem crops up with the IFE in the old cabin. I have flown Air Canada domestic, transcontinental and international multiple times to be able to say that the IFEs on their old and new cabins are chalk and cheese. On the most recent flight(s), I flew on the old cabin(s). The IFEs in the old cabins are slow, unresponsive and have a rather strange choice of music and programs. The headphones don't always work in old cabins either, but given that the most interesting thing on the old IFE could be the flight map, you might not need them at all. The IFEs in new cabins, however, are far better. It's overall a good and safe full-service airline with a good network and value for money. Due to COVID restrictions, we did not have a full meal service, but pretzels and biscuits were provided.",servic perspect air canada great ground telephon air staff polit profession practic accommod pilot well train provid suffici inform passeng along rout aircraft properli maintain cabin suffici clean main problem crop ife old cabin flown air canada domest transcontinent intern multipl time abl say ife old new cabin chalk chees recent flight flew old cabin ife old cabin slow unrespons rather strang choic music program headphon alway work old cabin either given interest thing old ife could flight map might need ife new cabin howev far better overal good safe full servic airlin good network valu money due covid restrict full meal servic pretzel biscuit provid
"✅Trip Verified| We returned from St-Lucia yesterday night, December 19th. It’s been 3 years now since we have flown with Air Canada. Due to our last few very bad experiences, we tried to avoid them at all costs. This time, we had no other choice than Air Canada to fly to Saint-Lucia. Three days before our return to Ottawa via Toronto, we notice on the AC application that our return flight will be delayed 2 hours, thus missing our connection in Toronto for Ottawa. They changed our flight to another time that was still impossible to catch. Arriving in Toronto late on Saturday night, the Air Canada employee was immediately firm about telling us they are not providing a hotel and meal voucher as they pretend it is ""out of their control"", they seem to have all the freedom to lie about what’s in or out of their control. To be honest we saw it coming, having experienced their completely non-existent customer relations in the past and after talking with some of their former employees (management level), it was our fear that we would face their abuse once more. Any other airline in the world would have treated this issue fairly (from experience). I am sure all Canadians would love to feel pride in our main airline and feel appreciated and be respected by a company that carries our flag around the globe. In reality, this airline is absolutely shameful, it abuses its customers every single day, and by the looks of it none of their employees are proud to represent this company either. As a Canadian that travelled around the world, the lack of service, appreciation and fairness from Air Canada is very obvious when comparing to any other airline.

✅Trip Verified| A warning to those thinking of purchasing a ticket with Air Canada. They are in the practice of refusing to refund the purchase price even after they choose to cancel the flight. In these Covid days flights are frequently cancelled through lack of passenger capacity. Air Canada would have been aware of this before they posted the flight. They claim that this practice is consistent with other airlines policies. This is totally untrue. They also claim that the cancellation is due to uncontrollable circumstances. This is also totally untrue. Air Canada chose to cancel the flight. In any civilised country an action like this would be considered fraud but apparently not in Canada.

"✅Trip Verified|  I booked my flight out of China after COVID-19 hit. China had already officially announced to the public a one-flight-a-week per country per airline policy, but when Air Canada continued listing daily flights out, I believed that Canada must have been an exception. I called to ask questions, but apparently I didn't ask the right ones. My flight was cancelled, then I rebooked, then it was cancelled again. Air Canada wasn't able to fly even once weekly until mid August, after many other airlines had resumed doing so. I eventually had to book a flight out on a Chinese airline, and had to frantically rehome my kitty as a result of Air Canada's false promises. The company is refusing to issue me refunds even for these flights that they never could have expected to take off. I used to feel confident about flying Air Canada. Now I don't intend to ever do so again.",book flight china covid hit china alreadi offici announc public one flight week per countri per airlin polici air canada continu list daili flight believ canada must except call ask question appar ask right one flight cancel rebook cancel air canada abl fli even weekli mid august mani airlin resum eventu book flight chines airlin frantic rehom kitti result air canada fals promis compani refus issu refund even flight never could expect take use feel confid fli air canada intend ever

Delays after delays without compensation, and whenever I go to the kiosk to ask them to put me on a different connecting flight, they are always reluctant and would tell me to contact Ctrip directly (where I originally booked my ticket).  Once I specifically asked about my tagged bags when they put me on a different flight, and after they explained to me that bags are attached to the barcode of my new boarding pass and that I have nothing to worry about, I went home without my bags for two days.

"✅Trip Verified|  Air Canada changed the flight itinerary for a Toronto-Seattle flight, and I could no longer make the flight due to this change. They offered to convert the value of my flight ($350) into a credit that I could use at a later date. I thought this was great, and proceeded to apply the credit to a different flight (Toronto-Dublin) which costs $590 on the AirCanada website, taxes included (Image attached). I would've expected that my $350 credit would be applied to the new $590 flight, and I'd just have to pay the remaining balance of $240. This is not what happened. The credit of $350 was only good for $43 dollars on this new flight, and the rest of the credit vanished ($307), and I'm now at a net expense of $853 because I was charged an additional $546 ""tax charge"" for the new Dublin flight booking (on top of the remaining $307 credit value that couldn't be applied and doesn't exist anymore). I was not informed that it would have been better to use my credit for the same Toronto-Seattle route, instead of applying the credit to a new destination where the taxes aren't transferable. So after realizing this on my own, I then tried to cancel that new booking to Dublin and receive a refund for the $546, as it was still within 24 hours of the booking confirmation. This way I could keep my original $350 credit to save for a later date to use for Seattle specifically, and get full use of the credit value, and just book the Dublin flight separately on my own. However, they said this was also not possible, as a new booking made with a credit isn't the same as a regular booking, so the 24 hour rule doesn't apply, and I'm left short $307 in credit value that doesn't exist. I've contacted their customer relations department, and they've responded saying they cannot assist me.  I've had multiple trip cancellations with other airlines, where my credits were kept and applied for the full value of the ticket. I don't understand how $350 dollars in credit only becomes $43 in usable valuable, while the rest goes down the drain. Don't advertise increased flexibility with credits and vouchers, when in fact they are imaginary and will leave you short hundreds of dollars. I hope this helps with other people who aren't sure what to do about a flight credit/ voucher with Air Canada.",air canada chang flight itinerari toronto seattl flight could longer make flight due chang offer convert valu flight credit could use later date thought great proceed appli credit differ flight toronto dublin cost aircanada websit tax includ imag attach would expect credit would appli new flight pay remain balanc happen credit good dollar new flight rest credit vanish net expens charg addit tax charg new dublin flight book top remain credit valu appli exist anymor inform would better use credit toronto seattl rout instead appli credit new destin tax transfer realiz tri cancel new book dublin receiv refund still within hour book confirm way could keep origin credit save later date use seattl specif get full use credit valu book dublin flight separ howev said also possibl new book made credit regular book hour rule appli left short credit valu exist contact custom relat depart respond say cannot assist multipl trip cancel airlin credit kept appli full valu ticket understand dollar credit becom usabl valuabl rest goe drain advertis increas flexibl credit voucher fact imaginari leav short hundr dollar hope help peopl sure flight credit voucher air canada

"Not Verified|  I Booked a Ticket Through +1 855-948-3661 , I recently had a horrible experience with my luggage on a Air Canada flight but it was corrected right immediately. After coming home from a work trip, the weather wasn't great and I was in a hurry to get home to my fur baby. I got my luggage and it was soaked and I assumed it was from the rain ... but I was wrong. I smelled something a little funny but didn't think much of it since there was a lot of people around. I threw my luggage in my car and while driving I started getting bursts of fishy odor. I got home and opened my trunk and almost fell over by the scent of fish. I took my luggage out and opened it and everything inside was covered in a gray liquid. My stuff was ruined. I came right back to the airport and Sherry and Luis helped me out. It was really embarrassing walking through the airport smelling like fish but they were so kind. The scent was so strong we had to cover our noses and hold our breath as we went through what items needed to be reimbursed. Luis took me to get a new suitcase since mine needed to be thrown away and Sherry gave me a nice Air Canada duffel bag to help transfer over some shoes and purses I wanted to try and clean. While it was a big inconvenience after a long and tiring day, I was happy with the outcome of the situation.

"✅Trip Verified|  I booked a flight 5 months in advance, from the booking date to two weeks before departure my flights kept on changing until i had 8 flights overlapping. There was no contact from Air Canada about the flight changes, I thought it was a technical issue with the app but when the problem was not resolved I contacted customer service and was told I would have to stay over night at my own expense at connecting airports on both directions. So my flight I paid extra for, to be as short as possible, was originally 6 hours there and back became 28 and 22 hours with no other option. It took 3 days of contacting customer support to get a reasonable flight rebooked. They wanted an extra 1200$ per ticket to change which would be triple of my original ticket and would take more than double the travel time. At multiple airports the counter staff tried moving me and my wife to opposite sides of the plane and called me selfish for not agreeing to their terms. Saying ""you are so me me me"" on top of the poor customer service the policy for free seat selection during 24 hour checkin changed and I had to pay an extra 98$ to sit next to my wife again!

At terminal 5 the agent said we have to go back to terminal 6 they would be responsible for our luggage.

"✅Trip Verified|  In December 2019 Air Canada cancelled my return ticket home while I was in Colombia. The return ticket included one domestic leg (Cartagena to Bogota) then two more legs, first to Toronto and then Vancouver. I missed the boarding call for the third leg of my incoming ticket so Air Canada, without even contacting me, cancelled all three of my flights home. After I missed my final short flight from Bogota to Medellin, I purchased another ticket from Latam Airlines, the local carrier for my last flight.  I spent six days using international minutes trying to reach Air Canada from Medellin. I tried everything under the sun to get a human voice on the line. Finally a friend of mine in Canada reached them, and after two and a half hours, got my flights home (the ones I’d already paid for) reinstated for $150. The money is the least of my concerns.

"Not Verified| Toronto to Vienna. I am Super Elite with Air Canada. I fly over 100,000 miles a year each year. Air Canada cancelled half of my flight (from Toronto to Vienna) but not the return flight. I called Super Elite desk to address the issue. The person on the phone just kept reading their new policies they put in place and giving me regular answers, I've asked to speak to the manager. Manager called me within and hour. I have explained my situation to the manager and it was silent. I thought may be call got disconnected. I have asked if anyone is still here to what manager was very rude, unprofessional. The manager replied: ""I was waiting till you will be finally done talking"". I was shocked. I didn't say anything. He didn't say nothing for over a minute. I then told him that I am taping his silence, waste of time and horrible treatment of other people. He screamed so loudly how dare I to tape him. Called me names and hung up.

"✅Trip Verified| Vancouver to Hong Kong. First things first, I flew business class after Covid-19 measures were implemented, so I came in expecting reduced cabin service, and that was what I got. That being said, even with all the precautionary measures, I was surprised that they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together. Air Canada uses the B/E Aerospace (Now Collins Aerospace) Super Diamond seats, which arrange passengers in a reverse herringbone configuration. It's a pretty standard product, though I must say I really like the colour scheme that Air Canada uses. It just looks really clean and the colours contrast nicely. Due COVID-19, I requested the upgrade to business as a precautionary measure, and I wasn't disappointed. Even with reduced cabin services, it was still a nice experience. Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you. It was still business quality (veal from Hawksworth), but they simply didn't give you that picture perfect plating that is so greatly appreciated. Despite the lack of a pillow, the seats were still quite comfortable, though it could still do with more lumbar support, and the lack of a pillow made the sleeping position a tad awkward because my head was dipped backwards even with the power adjustable headrest. Service could admittedly be a bit more polished, though to be fair, part of this definitely has to do with the COVID-19 precautions. I should probably try upgrading again when this blows over. I do appreciate how quiet the cabin was, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the food quality was not compromised as a result of their infection control measures.",vancouv hong kong first thing first flew busi class covid measur implement came expect reduc cabin servic got said even precautionari measur surpris still abl put somewhat decent servic togeth air canada use b e aerospac collin aerospac super diamond seat arrang passeng revers herringbon configur pretti standard product though must say realli like colour scheme air canada use look realli clean colour contrast nice due covid request upgrad busi precautionari measur disappoint even reduc cabin servic still nice experi sure pillow bar servic warn websit turn said would serv pre packag meal meant go plate meal still busi qualiti veal hawksworth simpli give pictur perfect plate greatli appreci despit lack pillow seat still quit comfort though could still lumbar support lack pillow made sleep posit tad awkward head dip backward even power adjust headrest servic could admittedli bit polish though fair part definit covid precaut probabl tri upgrad blow appreci quiet cabin pleasantli surpris see food qualiti compromis result infect control measur

"✅Trip Verified|  Washington to Quebec City via Montreal. We boarded the flight, but while we were awaiting takeoff we had to evacuate the plane due to a mechanical issue. After waiting a couple of hours for counter assistance, we were rebooked for another flight. We were advised that we could not continue on to Quebec that night, but would be rebooked for a flight the next day. Unfortunately, the flight was also delayed again and we arrived quite late When we arrived in Montreal the counter agents deliberated over whether we qualified for lodging as we had been promised, and we received a lecture on Air Canada’s cancelation policies. We were eventually provided hotel and meal vouchers, given directions to the shuttle, and confirmed our reservations for the flight for the next day. Our flight was cancelled the next morning due to weather, and we received an email notification that we were rescheduled for a flight two days later. We called Customer Service to see if we could get an earlier flight; the representative informed us we were scheduled for the earliest flight he could get us on to Quebec City. Since we would not have had any time 8n Quebec we decided to cancel our vacation and requested return flights Our return flight was delayed due to “Crew Availability Issues”. This delay would cause us to miss connecting flight in Ottawa. We immediately contacted the Air Canada agent at the boarding desk, who rescheduled us onto a direct flight to our home. Our Air Canada experience can be summarized as such: two flight cancellations, one for mechanical issues and one weather related; three delays, causing us to miss connections; cancellation of our Quebec Winter Carnival vacation plans; computer issues, and a stressful experience for my wife and me I think you can agree our experience with Air Canada was not universally positive. I think it is important to emphasize that if our original flight had not been cancelled for mechanical issues we would have arrived in Québec City before the snowstorm and enjoyed our vacation. We filed a claim with Air Canada for our (first) cancelled flight based on your policy of recompense for cancelled and delayed flights. Their official response was to claim the flight cancellation was beyond their control, but offered us a 15% discount on our next Air Canada flight. We have requested reimbursement for the Montreal to Quebec and return leg of our trip that we could not take.

"Not Verified|  I have to say that we were relatively surprised on a recent return trip from Sydney to Vancouver and back. The departures were within 10 minutes of planned take-off times, and arrivals were either on-time or early. Check-in at both airports was very straight-forward and special thanks to the lovely ground staff lady at Vancouver who helped with our self check-in / bag drop at the airport. The crew did their job but lack the polish and personal attention to detail that you receive with the likes of Emirates and Qatar (which is one of the reasons why they are among the worlds best airlines, and Air Canada isn't). We flew Premium Economy and I'm glad we did as I felt sorry for any passengers flying in economy in a full plane on the return flight. The food service in PE was poor with rubbery, burnt omelette, rock hard bread rolls and tasteless chicken on the return route - not helped by being offered only one small glass of wine. While the entertainment system was very good and extremely easy to navigate, the earphones offered in PE were next to useless. The provision of toilets on the aircraft was rather disproportionate with 5 lavatories for 260 economy / premium economy passengers against 3 for 40 business passengers.

"✅Trip Verified|  My last experience was a flight from Toronto to Mumbai. They made us wait almost 4 hours in the plane before taking off. They gave us mini oatmeal bars to help us wait, and half glass of water. They blame external circumstances (last time was: not enough employees to defrost the plane). Even for very simple flights like Montreal - NYC or Montreal - Miami they are late. Last time I went to Miami, flight delayed of 6 hours. Last time I went to NYC (1 hour flight), flight delayed of 2 hours. Don’t bother bringing a carry on: they never have space for them.

"Not Verified| Toronto to Rome via London. Air Canada treats Aeroplan members as second class citizens I am posting this warning to all those you fly with Air Canada and who use air miles to book flights. Air Canada clearly discriminates amongst its passengers. This is now my second experience and hence definitive confirmation of these discriminatory practices. I recently booked a flight to Europe from Toronto using my aeroplan miles. Upon booking my 2 flights I went through the seat selection process, selected seats and paid $125 each for that privilege. The payment was processed by Air Canada and written confirmation received of those specific seat allocations via email. Weeks later I received an “Air Canada – SEAT CHANGE” notification, arbitrarily moving our seats from Row 18 (seats bought and paid for – for extra legroom due to a leg issue I have) to Row 33. and then said I would be refunded the seat selection fees. Completely arbitrary and not honoring the initial seat purchase! Since this was the second time this has happened to me, (the first time being much worse, which I will explain later on in this message) I had to speak out. I immediately emailed Air Canada after trying to get a hold of their customer service Dept – advised by an automated call that the wait time was more than 1.5 hrs - really? Maybe this is a factor of the significant quantum of customer complaint volume. I then received the token automated response to my submission form Air Canada “we will address your concern within 30 days”. Hence my public action here! As noted this is the second time this has happened. In 2018, on flights to/from Miami for attending a family wedding, I had booked 4 seats using Aeroplan miles and paid full fare for one seat (full-fare seat for my disabled father) in upgraded seating. We booked almost 8 months in advance, with the express purpose of early booking, being getting our seats assigned together so as to assist my disabled father on/off the plan and supporting him during the flights. Eight months early! All our seat selections were confirmed in writing to us by Air Canada at that time. Again, just before the flight (a week before) we get a notification that our seats were changed. Let me clarify this point - only our Aeroplan booked seats were changed! Not my father’s full-fare seat! I called to complain, they said it just happens. It was too close to the flight to seek any other remedy. In the end, it left us sitting in the back of the plane and my father sitting alone with strangers and without support to deal with his disability! Unbelievable! After our return, I complained through proper AC channels to ascertain the genesis of the change notice, highlighting the blatant fact that only the seats booked with air miles were changed and not full-fare seat. The AC response again was, it happens! The offered me a 25% discount coupon for a future flight. I don’t want coupons! I want honest, fair and non-discriminatory service from a Canadian company. Disgraceful! Now this has happened again and cannot stay silent as it is now clear beyond any doubt that Air Canada discriminates against its passengers. There is one level of service for full-fare passengers and another for Aeroplan members who use air miles to book flights.

"✅Trip Verified|  Toronto to New York LGA return. The majority of flights on this route are currently operated by Sky Regional on E175s under the Air Canada Express banner. This morning, waiting at the gate, we got the preboard announcement, followed a minute later by a PA stating the flight was now cancelled due to the aircraft going tech. (followed by a text from AC) Rebooking is automatic and took 15 mins. I found myself (probably due to a low fare class) albeit 50K elite, on a flight at 1320 – some 4.15 hours after my original flight time. A paltry 10 bucks for refreshments was offered (try buying something to eat and drink at Pearson for ten bucks!!) Prior to boarding my new flight, the gate staff confirmed my bag was on the tarmac ready to be loaded. Two handlers at the bottom of the jetty confirmed that 15 bags had been loaded from an earlier flight. Despite these reassurances, having waited at the baggage reclaim – no bag. A queue to report it, an incorrectly filed report by the AC agent, the online system reported my bag would land at 2100 but no bag arrived that evening. On chasing AC the following morning by phone, it turns out my bag had iust been delivered to hotel reception – some 18 hours after I had landed and 11 hours since the bag arrived in New York. (the online report was not updated) I am losing count of the times AC have lost my bag. This is also my third flight cancelled on this route though at least this time the rebooked flight was the same day (unlike the last time). For a company who claim to be the best in North America, I find their continued inability and incompetence to operate their schedule and carry PAX and their bags on the same flight to be getting worse.",toronto new york lga return major flight rout current oper sky region e air canada express banner morn wait gate got preboard announc follow minut later pa state flight cancel due aircraft go tech follow text ac rebook automat took min found probabl due low fare class albeit k elit flight hour origin flight time paltri buck refresh offer tri buy someth eat drink pearson ten buck prior board new flight gate staff confirm bag tarmac readi load two handler bottom jetti confirm bag load earlier flight despit reassur wait baggag reclaim bag queue report incorrectli file report ac agent onlin system report bag would land bag arriv even chase ac follow morn phone turn bag iust deliv hotel recept hour land hour sinc bag arriv new york onlin report updat lose count time ac lost bag also third flight cancel rout though least time rebook flight day unlik last time compani claim best north america find continu inabl incompet oper schedul carri pax bag flight get wors

The attendants this time were especially bad. In particular the one who served me, who handed the food to the passenger on the aisle, and have him figure out the portion and pass it to each of us.

"Not Verified|  Flew into Tokyo from Bangkok on ANA, Nippon on a 787, economy class. We were offered water within 30 minutes of takeoff, a full elaborate and delicious dinner after an hour, then another drink service half an hour after that. We were offered a snak and drink again before landing. All of this on a 4.5 hour flight. The seats were a comfortable width with good leg room. This was a great flight experience. We were connecting on Air Canada Flight 2 to Toronto, connection time was 55 minutes, we were at the gate in about 25 minutes, boarding had not started, we boarded and lifted off about 45 minutes late, something about baggage loading problems. We paid extra for a preferred seat were in row 18 at the bulkhead, seat location was good, seat itself was very narrow and uncomfortable. (extra seating probably means extra luggage and with the allowance of 2 checked bags per person might explain luggage loading problems.) Three hours after takeoff there was no service whatsoever, not even water. Then there was an announcement that Air Canada was implementing a new service, they were offering a hot towel service and the availability of both hot chocolate and sparkling in Economy Lass. A special representative was on board to explain this innovation and to hand out a 20 question survey on this startling innovation. Water and a meal service followed. The main was horrible, a tiny salad, a tiny bun and a Twinkie like desert. After a discussion with their service people water was offered more frequently. An attempt to order duty free on board failed, an attendant tried to help but was not able to place the order. The duty free cart came by when I was asleep so no success there. This 11.5 hour flight was a very poor and uncomfortable esperiance. In the last two years we have travelled on KLM, Lufthansa, Air France,West Jet, Bangkok Air.

"Not Verified|  London Heathrow to Toronto with Air Canada. I am a million mile flyer so I have a lot of experience with traveling. I fail to understand why the baggage retrieval at Pearson Airport is consistently the worst I have experienced. Comparing Toronto with Paris, London, Zurich, Hong Kong, Vancouver, New York etc. etc. Typically, baggage at Toronto takes 30 to 50 minutes after having passed through customs and immigration. One wonders why the bags are not waiting for the passengers when they emerge from customs and immigration. At most other airports I have my baggage in no more that 20 minutes. In London, my bags are always on the carousel before I arrive. This continues to be an issue at Pearson (Air Canada) Terminal 1. I primarily fly Air Canada so my experience is with them. Frankly, I don’t care whether Air Canada blames Pearson management or whether Pearson blames Air Canada baggage handlers. This is a serious customer service problem that should be rectified. It is an embarrassment to Pearson and Air Canada both.

"✅Trip Verified|  Biggest Air Canada fan waning after A220 inaugural Flight Experience. I purchased a Comfort Class ticket on the Air Canada inaugural A200-300 flight on January 16th between Montreal and Calgary. When I reached my seat, boarding in Zone 5 I found that my aisle seat was already being encroached on by a Plus Sized passenger who had moved the arm rests up as he could not fit the confines of his seat.  This was certainly not a Comfort Class seat experience from my perspective, although probably an Air Canada bargain at just over $500.  I thought Air Canada would put their topnotch flight attendants on this flight as it was an inaugural flight of a new aircraft type! Instead the economy cabin was blessed with 2 lack lustre crew members. I went to use the washroom at the back of the airplane and two service carts were blocking the access to the lav that was open while the 2 flight attendants were busy snacking and socializing. The male flight attendant later manned the Bistro Cart in the aisle offered the menu to me and I had to ask him if he had my prepaid voucher recorded on his manifest. He looked at a sheet of paper on his cart, then looked above at my seat row and number then offered the meal item and snack item. I chose for a meal item the mac n cheese which was one of the few hot items available. The flight attendant warned me that it would be at least 30 minutes because he would have to heat it up first. This, while the plane was over northern Ontario. I decided by the time we were flying over Saskatchewan, I would check on that 30 minute Mac and Cheese. I went to the rear galley and found a  female flight attendant freshening up her makeup and I asked her if she knew anything about the 30 minute Mac N Cheese I had ordered off the Bistro Cart and she opened the oven and found the cardboard box with the Mac N Cheese which was probably cooking for and hour and a half. She admitted that the Male flight attendant could not remember who ordered the item.",biggest air canada fan wane inaugur flight experi purchas comfort class ticket air canada inaugur flight januari th montreal calgari reach seat board zone found aisl seat alreadi encroach plu size passeng move arm rest could fit confin seat certainli comfort class seat experi perspect although probabl air canada bargain thought air canada would put topnotch flight attend flight inaugur flight new aircraft type instead economi cabin bless lack lustr crew member went use washroom back airplan two servic cart block access lav open flight attend busi snack social male flight attend later man bistro cart aisl offer menu ask prepaid voucher record manifest look sheet paper cart look seat row number offer meal item snack item chose meal item mac n chees one hot item avail flight attend warn would least minut would heat first plane northern ontario decid time fli saskatchewan would check minut mac chees went rear galley found femal flight attend freshen makeup ask knew anyth minut mac n chees order bistro cart open oven found cardboard box mac n chees probabl cook hour half admit male flight attend could rememb order item

They have code-share and it is their responsibility. Lufthansa left without a single minute delay leaving passengers stranded at the airport for an indefinite time.

"✅Trip Verified| Zurich to Montreal. You have to be careful now with Air Canada. They started playing with their fares to make it as confusing as possible to get as much money as possible from the customer. At the time of booking, we chose a standard economy ticket as opposed to an Economy Light ticket to be sure to get our luggage included in the price and not have to care about it later. We got a booking confirmation also stating that we had in fact paid the Standard Economy fare and that our luggage was included. When we showed up at the airport however, with four pieces of luggage for the whole family, we had to pay 240 CHF additional per way. We were told that since our flight was a codeshare, the rules of the other company applied. We got no help from the Air Canada counter and we could not reach anyone on the phone after an hour of waiting. We wrote an Email to customer service which replied three weeks later stating that it was all our fault for not paying attention, even though their booking confirmation stated false information. That means that we paid more for a fare that did not give us what we expected of it.

We went early to the airport and tried to change our to another AC flight that was direct to Edmonton scheduled 15min after the Calgary one. The agent told us that flight was delayed an hour so we decided to bite the bullet and just transfer in Calgary. We also didn't want to further complicate our checked baggage finding its way home. Flight to Calgary left on time and went fine. As soon as we arrive in Calgary our flight to Edmonton gets delayed a couple times and eventually cancelled for mechanical issues. Flight rescheduled for the next morning. Colleague and I decided we're better off just renting a car at this point because we can't afford to miss another day of work. Customer service is brutal and dismissive of anyone's problems.,colleagu set fli toronto edmonton th januari flight got cancel due weather custom complet overwhelm flight got reschedul next morn reason got connect flight calgari went earli airport tri chang anoth ac flight direct edmonton schedul min calgari one agent told us flight delay hour decid bite bullet transfer calgari also want complic check baggag find way home flight calgari left time went fine soon arriv calgari flight edmonton get delay coupl time eventu cancel mechan issu flight reschedul next morn colleagu decid better rent car point afford miss anoth day work custom servic brutal dismiss anyon problem
"✅Trip Verified|  Before we departed, we discovered our return flight was changed by a day only  when we rang Air Canada to upgrade ... just per chance we had booked a connecting flight with Air Canada. Had we booked the connection with a different airline  we would have had to pay for the alteration to our flight. Also, we had to change plans and add another night to our New York accommodation. We had not been informed of the change, goodness know if and when Air Canada might have decided to inform us. The service from Melbourne to Vancouver was appalling. Food and drinks offered were the  minimum for what was a long flight. Alternatively staff on the flight from Vancouver to Montreal were exceptional. They went out of their way to assist, offer snacks, smile and just offer exceptional service. The contrast between the two flights was enormous, unfortunately we received bad service on the long flight. We are yet to make the return flight and it's not looking good.

"✅Trip Verified|  Connecting flight from Toronto to Halifax cancelled due to weather, ok understandable. Rebooked on flight later that night, which I got bumped from. One customer service agent at the desk provided really bad service too, I get that you're tired of dealing with customers but the lady was acting as if her flight got cancelled. She even complained to her colleague about having to hold with Air Canada when phoning to get help with the situation. So I'm put on the 10:00 flight for 06 Jan 2020, I even get checked in and get a boarding pass. An hour later I get an email saying I'm now bumped from this flight and on the 18:30 flight. This cannot be due to weather as the 10:00 flight is not cancelled. Now I've been on hold for over an hour waiting to speak with someone. They really need to hire more customer service agents for the call center considering how much the company is messing up lately. They also told everyone that hotels will not be provided because it was due to weather, stranding a bunch of people.

"✅Trip Verified|  My flight to Vancouver was cancelled and I was notified of the cancellation the day before, with a note that a follow up email on the rescheduled flight would be sent. However, I did not get an email. I tried calling in for hours on end with no one to assist and also wrote in requesting for help. Nothing happened. I went down the next day to realise that there was a rescheduled flight that I was not notified of, even through I was booked into it. The staff at the airport did not offer to help and asked us to get back on the phone to get through to the billing, but again did not get through. I did not manage to get on the later flight that day and had to purchase another ticket with United Airlines the next day.  This was a terrible and frustrating experience that left me at a loss of words about Air Canada’s service standards.

Upon arriving in Paris it came to my surprise that none of the checked-in baggage has arrived. Upon checking with the ground staff in Paris I was informed that ground staff in Montreal didn't have enough time to transfer my baggage to the second flight going to Paris. My trip was booked through air Canada website including the transit. I followed up with Baggage services who confirmed that baggage did not leave Montreal and will be send on a different flight. Following arrival it will be scheduled for delivery in Paris. This process could take up to 5 days.

When a companies cabin crew apologises for their in-flight entertainment being really bad and in not a good working order for many passengers because the systems are so old, you would think an over haul would have been done: But you would have been mistaken! After three starts and reboots of the system followed by a discussion with ground staff as to how to fix the fact the entertainment system didn't work, the company resorted to 'vouchers' which required a passenger to log into Air Canada's website to be reimbursed! But oh no, don't think you will get anything back, you are.offered 15% off your next flight cost but you must fly within the year. So my question is, what about all those customers who, like me won't be flying again within the year as we saved for this holiday.

I just ran through the Vancouver airport to make an earlier flight to Portland. They were still boarding passengers and completely refused to help. Had no empathy for the next flight being a four-hour wait. She was not helping and yelled at me for asking more than once. I understand the rules and regulations.

Finally after several attempts, when I got through to an agent after 60 mind waiting, they told me I have to do the upgrade in the airport. The system doesn’t allow them to do it over the phone, However, when I got to the airport, the ground service people told me I have to do it online it or on the phone, the system doesn’t allow them to do it at the airport, it’s very frustrating that it’s already wasted 2 hours of my life just to get to speak to someone over the phone. No one could help me with my request. After I got to the airport, I was 2 mins late from the check in timeline, I found out that they took my seats away and told me I had to rebook a flight. I had no choice but to go to ticketing booth, after waiting there for almost 2 hours at ticketing booth, the staff had trouble getting through their system after 15 mins of trying, told me because I used Aeroplan miles for my ticket, there is nothing they can do, I have to contact Aeroplan to get a new ticket.  It would be more considerate if they let me know that ticketing booth doesn’t help anyone with aeroplane reward ticket before sending me there, so I don’t waste another 2 hours waiting there pointlessly.

"Not Verified| Regina to Montreal via Toronto. What is described below is not a one-time occurrence, it has a rather disturbing high frequency on my travels. Paid for a more expensive flight to arrive earlier as I had an event. Wasted my money due to the delays. The departing flight (AC1114 from Regina to Toronto) was delayed due to ""additional flight preparation time"". The flight was then delayed two more times, to the point of missing my connection. To top it off, when consulting the departing gate to change the missed connection, was instructed to do so in Toronto. I made the big mistake of being nice to them and checked my carry on to assist them with space for other passengers. Big mistake as the whole Air Canada Toronto personnel that I consulted seemed to be trained to purposely do nothing to change a flight if baggage is checked. When requesting for an earlier flight, one of the people asked if I wanted to go on the next flight, to what I answer ""Yes!"" to then tell me he couldn't do it because of the checked luggage and telling me that he needed 1h and 15min for changing. Asked then for a flight apart 1.5 hrs, to what they say ""cannot do with checked luggage"". Do you notice the change of tone there? If this was a single occurrence, I would have said ""one time thing"" but this is the third time out of four flights I've got. Due to the frequency, I will avoid at all cost. I hope you do the same.

"✅Trip Verified| Boston to Tokyo via Toronto. My first flight on Air Canada this morning was delayed due to weather. When I arrived in Toronto I had missed the connection and they handed new boarding passes which get me to my destination two days after I was supposed to arrive. I was taking this flight because it was nonstop and paid for premium economy. They’ve provided me with a hotel for one night but I end up now going through Korea and have to spend a night in the airport without a hotel. I have been on hold on their help phone for over one hour. I have also been at the customer ticketing booth and took a number which was number 243 3: 207 PM today and after an hour and 15 minutes, they had only served 40 people. I Was on hold for over one hour when someone finally answered. After explaining the situation and indicating I would be willing to go to a different airport in Tokyo the woman said to please hold and after about 15 minutes I was disconnected. I am now starting over and I’m now on hold to speak to someone again. I’ve tried calling them myself on my cell phone however if you listen to the recording it literally says that they will not take your call because of their new reservation system. Please see photos showing how they have rebooked me with three additional flights going through another country and ending up at my destination two days later. This is totally unacceptable and I can’t even speak to someone to see if there are any alternatives which is why I am posting this review as I stay on hold. In addition, I went to three lines at the airport to try to get help and each person sent me somewhere else. I will never ever fly this airline again. It’s one thing to offer me a hotel in Toronto this evening but then to expect me to arrive in Korea and spend the night on a chair waiting for a flight is also unacceptable aside from all these time issues.

She kept saying “I don’t know. Can’t help you” even though she has the tools to look up my booking to see if there’s any issues on my end or hers. I had to ask her work colleague for help.

"Not Verified|  The flight from Taipei to Vancouver was decent. But it was hard to get comfortable in the seats in order to catch some sleep on the 10 hour journey. What made us most angry was our treatment at Vancouver airport while trying to catch our connecting flight back to Toronto. We had less than 2 hours to go through customs, get our baggage, then recheck baggage before boarding. Of course going through security was slow and on top of that, baggage claim had mechanical issues so we were delayed another 10 minutes. By the time we reached baggage drop off, the agent simply told us too late and that we missed our flight. No explanation or any effort whatsoever to reach out to the agents boarding for our flight. We got redirected to a check in area where we were then booked as standby for the next flight with the agent telling us that we would most likely get on. Now we understand seats are not guaranteed but at least have the agents be a little empathetic about our situation that was not our fault. Cue boarding time for the standby flight: the agent was rude and bluntly told all standbys that we were not getting on. Naturally people were upset and wanted answers. But this particular agent was so rude and yelled back at everyone to shut up as there was nothing she can do on her end. Funny, I thought these agents are supposed to provide customer service? Didn't know being yelled at and made to feel like missing our original flight was part of their job description. I can understand feeling attacked when you have angry customers all come at you, but that's part of your job to be able to keep your cool in these situations! After a bit of yelling back and forth, she rebooked us all as standbys for the last flight of the night with a small chance of boarding as this was yet another full flight. She couldn't or wouldn't tell us what our other options are if we were to be denied this last flight as well. So here we are waiting for the last flight hoping to get on while we're all upset with how we were just treated. Long story short, the flight crew was lovely but ground staff? Please hire agents who actually care about helping passengers who are stuck here. It's not like we all voluntarily decided to skip our original flights in favour of playing chance with the later flights. Worst customer service experience we've ever experienced. Would highly recommend avoid flying with Air Canada if you can.

"✅Trip Verified| On Sat 30 November 2019, I was due to fly from London to Chicago, via Toronto. I successfully completed the London to Toronto leg of my journey. All of my problems began with the Toronto to Chicago leg of this journey (UA 7673 on 30 November 2019). I boarded the plane, but was then told that there was a fault with the plane. All passengers were told to disembark the plane. I expected to be booked on to another flight for that day, but was informed by Air Canada Staff at the gate that there would be no further flights that day. I was told to collect my luggage and leave the airport. I was given the Air Canada customer support phone number and was told to contact them to arrange an alternative flight. I tried calling this number continuously for the next 12 hours. I was unable to get through to a customer support agent, despite holding for up to 4 hours! I kept getting a message saying that I could not be placed on hold, with a request to call back later. The message did not change for the whole time I was ringing! When I checked my booking online, I could see that my YYZ to ORD had been rescheduled for 4 days later (Wednesday 3 December 2019). This was despite the fact that there were numerous seats available on Air Canada flights between Toronto and Chicago on the 1st and 2nd of December. As I was unable to contact Air Canada customer support to arrange an alternative flight, I had no choice but to make my own arrangements for travel to Chicago. I proceeded to book a flight from Buffalo NY to Toronto for Sunday morning 1 December 2019 at 7.15 am. I am extremely disappointed by Air Canada. I understand that planes can occasionally develop a fault, leading to a cancellation. However, the failure of Air Canada to answer the phone is absolutely disgraceful.",sat novemb due fli london chicago via toronto success complet london toronto leg journey problem began toronto chicago leg journey ua novemb board plane told fault plane passeng told disembark plane expect book anoth flight day inform air canada staff gate would flight day told collect luggag leav airport given air canada custom support phone number told contact arrang altern flight tri call number continu next hour unabl get custom support agent despit hold hour kept get messag say could place hold request call back later messag chang whole time ring check book onlin could see yyz ord reschedul day later wednesday decemb despit fact numer seat avail air canada flight toronto chicago st nd decemb unabl contact air canada custom support arrang altern flight choic make arrang travel chicago proceed book flight buffalo ny toronto sunday morn decemb extrem disappoint air canada understand plane occasion develop fault lead cancel howev failur air canada answer phone absolut disgrac
"Not Verified|  My husband and I travel at least 4-5 times per year via Air Canada. Ninety percent of the time we fly business class. This trip to Atlanta and back has been one of the worst we’ve experienced. The flight FYI Toronto to Atlanta was over 3 hours late. Although weather was a factor, the messages to passengers were very misleading. The return flight was 35 minutes delayed, with no explanation. My entertainment system did not work, after informing the attendant, he provided a discount claim card, which lead us to believe this was a known issue. I wouldn’t have been so put off, but overheard other passengers in business class saying they were given complimentary upgrades. Their entertainment systems worked fine, while mine, which was a fully paid Bus Class ticket did not.  I can only hope they read this and perhaps understand where they might try to make some customer service advancements.",husband travel least time per year via air canada nineti percent time fli busi class trip atlanta back one worst experienc flight fyi toronto atlanta hour late although weather factor messag passeng mislead return flight minut delay explan entertain system work inform attend provid discount claim card lead us believ known issu put overheard passeng busi class say given complimentari upgrad entertain system work fine mine fulli paid bu class ticket hope read perhap understand might tri make custom servic advanc

We have an upcoming trip in January and  I have received a new itinerary. The latest one has my out going flight leaving 4 hours early causing me to have to leave work early to catch it and the return they decided to add an 8hr stop over right in the middle. The 8 hour stop over also causes me to get in late at night. I paid for the flights I booked because they work for the time off i booked. I didnt pay to have my itinerary changed for the worse. I dont feel like air canada has any respect for their customers. Their call centers are currently not even taking calls.

"✅Trip Verified| Toronto to San Francisco. I stopped flying Air Canada last year after so many bad experiences. But unfortunately WestJet doesn't do direct flights to San Francisco, so I was stuck on Air Canada again this month. And as always the experience was terrible. It is a total joke that they say they are the highest rated North American airline. They are the worst airline that I have flown on. The staff are completely unfriendly and not helpful. The flights are almost always late. I am waiting on my flight back and felt the need to write this review since my inbound flight is late so not really surprized.

"✅Trip Verified|  I used Air Canada's reward system Aeroplan to book a flight and could only get a seat on a United flight. It went through the system including assigning a seat. However, it said it was unticketed. I waited 24 hours to see if the ticket was issued - and then spent hours trying to get through to both Air Canada and Aeroplan after United told me that I should contact them to put a priority on issuing the ticket ASAP because they would cancel the reservation if it is not issued soon. Both contact centres talk about changes to the reservation system and it is causing lots of problems - but this has been going on for weeks based on comments on various forums. And they point the blame on each other - despite one being bought out by the other. The lack of effort to add more staff and to extend Aeroplans hours is disgraceful and and both parties should be ashamed by their lack of acceptance that customer are paying the consequences of an ill planned change. After spending hours dialing to just get into the queue to talk to Air Canada or Aeroplan [I had two phones going at the same time]. I finally spoke to a human at Air Canada who refused to acknowledge any connection to Aeroplan tickets and basically said keep trying to connect. Honestly I spent over 5 hours continuously redialing the Aeroplan number which stopped working at midnight. I have less that 36 hours before I am suppose to fly and no ticket. I would donate my points to charity as I plan to avoid using Aeroplan in the future, but it would be such a mean gesture to give something that could never be used.",use air canada reward system aeroplan book flight could get seat unit flight went system includ assign seat howev said unticket wait hour see ticket issu spent hour tri get air canada aeroplan unit told contact put prioriti issu ticket asap would cancel reserv issu soon contact centr talk chang reserv system caus lot problem go week base comment variou forum point blame despit one bought lack effort add staff extend aeroplan hour disgrac parti asham lack accept custom pay consequ ill plan chang spend hour dial get queue talk air canada aeroplan two phone go time final spoke human air canada refus acknowledg connect aeroplan ticket basic said keep tri connect honestli spent hour continu redial aeroplan number stop work midnight less hour suppos fli ticket would donat point chariti plan avoid use aeroplan futur would mean gestur give someth could never use
"✅Trip Verified|  Frankfurt to Nashville via Toronto. Our Frankfurt to Toronto leg was perfect. Staff was friendly, plane was comfortable, and flight was great. Once landing in Toronto, the chaos ensued. Our Nashville leg was cancelled due to weather (freezing rain and snow). Totally understandable. However, what wasn't understandable was the sheer incompetence of the Air Canada agents that helped customers. Once we arrived at the connections gate for the US flights, there was 1 Air Canada agent helping over 200 people that needed a flight rebooked. On top of that, they apparently had a new rebooking system, so she couldn't actually rebook anyone without having to wait on the phone with another department to see if anything was available. The first person in line took 2 hours to get resolved. I was fourth in line. Finally my husband and I received a hotel voucher after about 2.5 hours of waiting in the line. They stopped trying to rebook anyone and just immediately gave us a hotel. Then they told us we need to call their reservations hotline to get rebooked. No one would rebook us without calling this number and the hold times for that number were over 2 hours and longer with frequent disconnects. We were told to exit customs and go downstairs to baggage claim to collect our stuff and head to the hotel. We waited 8 hours for our baggage and it never came.  We spoke to baggage agents 7 times and had them call our specific bag tag numerous times over with no luck. One agent even showed us a picture of our baggage scanned into the warehouse and knew the exact cage number it was stored in, but no one would retrieve it for us. Baggage agents instead walked around telling people to wait for carousel 10 to have their bags (which was futile) or openly started arguing with customers. ""Have you seen the weather? It's out of our control! There are many people here waiting, you need to wait!"" I asked one agent if he could radio for a manager and he said he couldn't, that there was no way for him to get a manager, and that he could not help. The customer service was atrocious. We all knew that weather was not something they could not control, but the baggage operations are within their control and it was a complete and utter failure.  After being awake for over 24 hours and trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage, we had to give up. The next morning we ended up hiring a limo service to take us to Buffalo in order to rent a car to get to Nashville. We were never able to contact the rebooking department for help and no one in the airport could help us. My husband has filed a baggage claim for them to send it to us, if they ever get around to getting it.

"✅Trip Verified|  London to Los Angeles via Toronto. Online check-in not possible, as ticked issued by United under a code-share flight number, thus stuck in a middle seat for the first leg. London to  Toronto uneventful, plane clean, crew indifferent, service average. Transfer in Toronto - a disorganized disaster. Premium security lane for US bound flights was an insult. Nobody in the airport seemed to be at work, or willing to do anything. Flight was originally delayed by 45 due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft and moved to a new gate. At the new gate, another hour delay was announced. 10 minutes prior to new boarding time, a further 2 hour delay and new change of gate was announced. No attempt from staff to provide water or vouchers. 20 minutes after moving to the new gate (at the opposite end of the terminal), a new announcement came through that the aircraft was now ready to board at the original gate. Following a sprint back to the old new gate on the opposite end of the terminal, finally boarded. Left gate 2 hours after the originally scheduled time and lined up for de-icing, which lasted for another hour or so. Cabin crew did not offer anything during that time except for headphones. Finally airborne, three and a half hours after the originally scheduled time, an apology from the purser for the delay and the generous offering of free headphones to compensate for the inconvenience. Meal for purchase and drinks service began almost 2 hours after take-off, due to sporadic turbulence. First went the cart with the meals for purchase. Water was offered to me for the first time 4 hours after I boarded the plane.

"✅Trip Verified| Took flights from Melbourne to Newark airport via Vancouver. All services up to arriving at Newark was good. However, after 2 hours of waiting for baggage, we have learned that my suit did not come with the aircraft I took from Vancouver. This happened to all people flew from Melbourne. No staff informed any of us the issue until one of us approached the Air Canada service desk. Even after founding out that baggage were misplaced and not arriving the airport on the same date, none of the Air Canada staff were supportive, helpful nor agile ('it is not my fault that baggage did not arrive' quote from an Air Canada ground staff). All reactive with reluctance and very slow process. We had about 20 to 25 people facing the same issue after almost 25 hours of travelling from Melbourne including several very small kids. This is not about missing luggage but about extremely poor services provided to their customers on this occasion. I flew on business class and left the airport without my suitcase after 3.5 hours of arrival due to the extremely inattentive and slow process. This is the worst ground staff service I ever received.

"✅Trip Verified| Fly between Vancouver and London Heathrow frequently and decided to fly in Air Canada Premium Economy in November. The experience was a major disappointment - the Air Canada premium product is far below the standard offered by other major carriers, including British Airways on the same route. Dinner was marginally better than economy class but wines were exactly the same as offered in economy. Breakfast was appalling - a slice of cake, a small yogurt and one cup of weak coffee. The food on BA is considerably better and they provide a hot breakfast. While the seat was more comfortable than in economy, it came with a flimsy pillow and a useless acrylic sheet that passed for a blanket. BA provides a quilted blanket. Service was generally mediocre; none of the FAs seemed interested in their jobs. Overall, Air Canada’s Premium Economy product and service is disappointing and definitely not worth the hefty additional cost.",fli vancouv london heathrow frequent decid fli air canada premium economi novemb experi major disappoint air canada premium product far standard offer major carrier includ british airway rout dinner margin better economi class wine exactli offer economi breakfast appal slice cake small yogurt one cup weak coffe food ba consider better provid hot breakfast seat comfort economi came flimsi pillow useless acryl sheet pass blanket ba provid quilt blanket servic gener mediocr none fa seem interest job overal air canada premium economi product servic disappoint definit worth hefti addit cost

We arrived at the gate at 7:06am and were denied entrance for our 7:00am flight. Many people were paged over the intercom about their flights giving them warnings and we were not. The lady at customer service then had the audacity to say “if you were paged, would you have made it?” As if it’s not their responsibility to do so regardless. Also the same lady said there was a flight at 8:00am but she couldn’t book us in because of the time. I was furious at this point as they sent us back out to the ticketing booth where there were about 15 employees behind the desk and only 3 at the computer. We waited over and hour to be attended to.

"Not Verified|  Worst experience with an airline. We flew from Montego Bay to Toronto Canada as a layover. As we boarded the plane the Captain advised that it was snowing in Canada, but we will be on time. As we arrived to the Toronto airport we spent a hour and a half on the runway. Due to traffic and the airline plowing. You would think they would of plowed ahead of time or at least prepped for snow. So are connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes as we lay in wait on the runway. We checked Air Canada site and it stated that our connecting flight was delayed 2 hours. So my wife and I believed we had time to make the connecting flight being that we were sitting for our an hour on the runway. Well we were wrong not only didn’t they let people with connecting flights exit off plane first but the staff and the website lied about the delay. (The connecting flight was on time) As we approached the gate to our flight we were stopped and not allowed to enter US customs because they closed at 9pm. We arrived at the gate at 849pm and had time to walked 50 feet to customs. But not to our knowledge Air Canada already rebooked our flight for the following day for 920pm without advising us. The staff was rude and blamed it on US customs even after we told them we have 11 minutes. Then they advised that we couldn’t go through customs because our check bag was on our previous flight. We explained that they can send the bag at a later date because we have to get home to our kids. Note there are over 25 other people they denied as well. Also, other airlines sent our check bag at a later date of flights were running late. Furthermore, Air Canada did book our hotel rooms but did not state when we had to check out. So at 11am the next day we received a phone call that we have to check out. Our flight wasn’t due to arrive until 920pm. What were we supposed to do from 11am to at least 7 pm. With no winter clothes because we are coming from Jamaica and we didn’t have our clothes due to the checked bag being on the previous plane. We called several Air Canada customer service lines and we met with excuses. I will never fly Air Canada or will recommend this airline. We were warned but decided to try them out anyway. Lastly, my wife checked for flights and they had a flight leaving Toronto at 11am the next day but Air Canada boomed is on the last flight leaving because it was more convenient for them.

"Not Verified|  London to Toronto. I found this trip on Air Canada's B777-300ER pretty overwhelming. I enjoyed the cabin feel and the colours.  The IFE was not going to be activated till after takeoff, and that meant that there would be no WiFi until the IFE was on. Then came a cockpit PA 'Attention passengers, this is your captain speaking. We will be delayed by 1 hour due to an accident on the apron.' That accident was a pushback truck that broke down, and they needed to move it. They couldn't turn on the IFE until at least one engine was on. One hour later we pushed back, and the IFE came on. I decided to check out the entertainment selection. As this was a 1:30 PM flight, lunch was served shortly after takeoff. My cheesy pasta was sufficient. After the meal, I checked the WiFi, and the prices were pretty reasonable. $29.78 for full flight of WiFi (that's 5 hours from LHR-YYZ). Later in the flight, we were served some kind of pie/wrap thing with chicken in it.",london toronto found trip air canada b er pretti overwhelm enjoy cabin feel colour ife go activ till takeoff meant would wifi ife came cockpit pa attent passeng captain speak delay hour due accid apron accid pushback truck broke need move turn ife least one engin one hour later push back ife came decid check entertain select pm flight lunch serv shortli takeoff cheesi pasta suffici meal check wifi price pretti reason full flight wifi hour lhr yyz later flight serv kind pie wrap thing chicken

"✅Trip Verified|  Montreal to Tokyo. The welcoming staff at Montreal airport was unbelievably rude. The check-in machines were not working and there was only one desk open for the check-ins. One desk for the largest company in one of the most important airports in Canada, unbelievable. After 20 minutes of waiting without any improvement, people started asking the staff what was happening and we were just told; ""20 minutes is nothing, if you're still in line in 6 hours you can come talk to me again but before that, it's not my problem, get over it"". The rest of the check-in and management staff on the ground though were all very nice and accommodating after I have to say. The flight was a 13,5 hours to Tokyo in a Boeing 787. Plane was nice enough and all the cabin crew staff were very good and welcoming. I was not expecting much for the food but this went beyond anything I had. The chicken was white and dry and had a blend tomato sauce with it...I actually felt sick and disgusted after eating it. I don't know what the breakfast was supposed to be but I could not finish it. For an airline that considers itself the best in North America, they really really need to improve their game.",montreal tokyo welcom staff montreal airport unbeliev rude check machin work one desk open check in one desk largest compani one import airport canada unbeliev minut wait without improv peopl start ask staff happen told minut noth still line hour come talk problem get rest check manag staff ground though nice accommod say flight hour tokyo boe plane nice enough cabin crew staff good welcom expect much food went beyond anyth chicken white dri blend tomato sauc actual felt sick disgust eat know breakfast suppos could finish airlin consid best north america realli realli need improv game
"✅Trip Verified|  Atlanta to Toronto on an Embraer 175. Check-staff were not welcoming to me and did their basic duties without much enthusiasm. My ticket terms stated that I was eligible for same-day standby on an earlier flight, but they insisted on charging me for the change, and could not offer any explanation except ""the computer says so"". I showed them my ticket and again, they said the computer tells them to charge the change fee. This despite the fact that I had called the airline and the customer service agent on the phone told me to show up early at the airport to make the change free of charge. The flight was rather uneventful. The plane was old, and seats cramped in Economy. The crew were similarly very disinterested and unenthusiastic to me. At the end of the flight, the chief purser stood by the door texting on his phone, and barely acknowledged the passenger disembarking - the crew on the outbound flight three days earlier was a remarkable contrast. Half way through the flight, the entertainment system broke down. The crew said they would reset the system, but they could not.",atlanta toronto embraer check staff welcom basic duti without much enthusiasm ticket term state elig day standbi earlier flight insist charg chang could offer explan except comput say show ticket said comput tell charg chang fee despit fact call airlin custom servic agent phone told show earli airport make chang free charg flight rather unev plane old seat cramp economi crew similarli disinterest unenthusiast end flight chief purser stood door text phone bare acknowledg passeng disembark crew outbound flight three day earlier remark contrast half way flight entertain system broke crew said would reset system could
